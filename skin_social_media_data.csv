I’m really struggling with my skin lately and I could use some guidance. My skin has been getting worse with each passing day and I can’t figure out why. My diet isn’t junk-heavy, I mostly eat homemade food and I walk regularly, so I don’t think lifestyle is the issue.

The texture on my forehead has been there for about two years, and I have pitted scars on my cheeks, but recently I’ve started getting random acne again. The texture, the jawline, everything just feels like it’s getting worse day by day. It’s really affecting my confidence.

Here’s the routine I follow:
	•	Morning: CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser or Paula’s Choice Salicylic Acid Cleanser, then Illiyoon Cream (the ceramide one), niacinamide serum after facewash, and sunscreen.
	•	Night: Same routine, but I also use 0.05% tretinoin.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I don’t just want routine recommendations. I want to understand what I can do for my skin and my body overall to improve texture, pigmentation, and early sagging. I’m not even that old for my skin to look like this.

Any advice would really help. Thank you.",[Routine help] Skin is getting worse,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1p28l9q/routine_help_skin_is_getting_worse/,1,Defiant-Condition947,2,"[Routine help] Skin is getting worse Hi everyone,

Should I go back to my old routine or should I stop using all active ingredients? Would the moisturizer and sunscreen clog it more? Should I wait it out or should I get some treatments?

Since then my skin care routine at the moment is cerave foaming cleanser (oily skin which I don’t have at the moment) and cerave moisturizing cream (for normal to dry skin). This is for the morning and at night I only use the cream.

I was also prescribed clindamycin and Tretinoin. I use both of these once in a while

Yesterday I randomly noticed my skin sort of peeling and after using the cream at night I have the same this morning.

I’m pretty worried and I’m not sure what to do? What products should I use to fix this and what should I do in general. My skin is very dry and I also have continuos dry spots in one side of my mouth and on my eye lids but the almost glue like skin is new.

I've always had clear skin ever since and although i would get some pimples from time to time, the healing process of it would only lasts a week and wouldn't leave scars.

Last september, I noticed some bumps forming between my brows so I bought a 1% salicylic acid gel cleanser which I believed caused me to breakout because I used it everyday for weeks! Initially, I thought it was just purging that's why I continued using it not until I developed some deep painful cycstic acne that made me stop using it. I also incorporated some spot treatments on the active pimples that time that i didn't know had salicylic acid on it and ended up making my skin worse.

I instantly dropped all the products I was using and switched to a gentle cleanser, ceramide moisturiser, and sunscreen for a week. Right now, I'm trying to slowly introduce cosrx salicylic acid daily gentle cleanser by using it every other day (I've used the said cleanser everyday a year before and never had any problem with it, it also made my comedones on my foreheads before disappear). Also, I use a serum that focuses on fading dark spots/scars, which have worked on some of my scars and I use a 20% azelaic acid on both of the deep cystic pimple that left a brown-reddish bump on my skin (right cheek and left cheek).

For AM I Use: Cosrx Gentle Cleanser Soul Apothecary Radiance Boost Serum Ceramide Moisturiser Non comedogenic Sunscreen

For PM I use: Celeteque Gentle Cleanser 20% Azelaic acid (3x a week) Ceramide Moisturiser

I’ve struggled with VERY bad hormonal acne ever since I first hit puberty. When I was 17, I took Accutane, and it helped a lot.

Before considering Accutane for a second time (since I know how harsh it is on the body), I really want to try a proper skincare routine.

The main problem I struggle with is dark spots after the pimples. Even when I don’t pop them, they turn into hyperpigmented marks, and it’s so frustrating.

Morning:
• CeraVe Blemish Control Cleanser
• Vitamin C serum (sometimes)
• Sunscreen

Night:
• Kojic acid &amp; turmeric soap
• The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA

reddit,r/SkincareAddiction,1p22nro,2025-11-20 13:05:50+00:00,"Hey guys 👋🏻 

Long time lurker here, I'm trying to incorporate oils into my skincare routine. Years ago my skin would drink it up with no problem and I was using the Pai Rosehip Oil over a ceramide serum which got discontinued. 

Over the last 3 years, my skin has became combination dry/dehydrated with eczema on the forehead. My barrier got wrecked from trying to incorporate too many new products like 2 years ago and from product reformulations (I also think I went through some hormonal changes too). Ever since, I've tried every barrier supporting product under the sun and have managed to find a simple routine that has been working since July (routine posted at bottom). Now that we're coming into winter I wanted to add an oil in to support my barrier.

However, every time I try an oil (recently re-tried Pai Rosehip Oil) my forehead gets scaly, greasy, itchy and I break out in the same spot everytime. I've took other Redditors advice of adding oil as the last component but even with other layers of skincare underneath I still get the same itchy, scaly reaction. Does anyone know what this could be? Is it fungal acne? I'm at a loss here.

Routine:

AM:

- Splash with water
- Organic Aloe Vera Gel
- Geek &amp; Gorgeous Happier Barrier Cream
- Organic Shea Butter
- SPF

PM:

- Double Cleanse with QV Wash
- Same as above just without SPF

Important note: I stopped using any actives since July to give my skin a break and to help my barrier. Also, I think I'm sensitive to fatty alcohols, citric acid and phenoxyethanol. I also seen a private dermatologist who was absolutely useless, they gave me Cetraben for my forehead but my skin hates paraffin so couldn't use it. I was using vaseline for a while but was still breaking out on my cheeks so swapped to Shea butter which has been working better.

Any advice would be appreciated.",[Routine Help] Am I doing something wrong with oil?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1p22nro/routine_help_am_i_doing_something_wrong_with_oil/,1,Bambi996,2,"[Routine Help] Am I doing something wrong with oil? Hey guys 👋🏻

I booked with an independent esthetician via ClassPass that had great reviews on ClassPass and google as well as is located in a super nice area near other high end med spas. However, once I got there, I was skeptical of the vibe. For example, she’s been an esthi for 20+ years (so she has experience), but began to tell me I needed to switch my skin routine to certain products without being prompted and without consulting me on what I’ve tried. I felt like that was odd. She also asked me for a tip at the end which felt unprofessional.  As I was leaving, she told me I shouldn’t peel and there wouldn’t be any other effects other than brighter, tighter skin.

The next day, I started to develop large comedones all over my face, but nothing inside them. There were probably 30 comedones.

For context, I have never had large comedones and been super fortunate with clear skin with not much texture. I was getting the peel to help with rosacea and pore size. After the peel though, I literally looked like I was out of a horror movie, so I have no photos bc I was unbelievably self conscious. When I googled it said that the skin purges, so is that a normal purge?

I’m 25, but I’m starting to notice some fine lines on my forehead (and some dark spots). My main concern is my skin texture, as I have very visible pores. I used to suffer from acne, but I don’t have any active blemishes now. However, my skin texture still looks rough and it gets red easily. My skin is also quite oily, but I’ve noticed that when I hydrate properly, the oiliness decreases.

**AM:**

* Foam cleanser
* COSRX Snail mucin
* Avéne PhysioLif day cream

**PM:**

* Double cleansing
* G9SKIN White in Milk Toner
* COSRX Snail mucin
* Avéne PhysioLif day cream

I’m thinking about introducing **vitamin C** in the morning and **retinol** once a week at night to start addressing texture, pores, and early signs of aging… but I’m not sure what would be best for sensitive skin, or what would work well with the products I already have. I’ve realized that my skin **loves** the **G9SKIN toner**, so I’ll never give it up lol.

Do you have any product recommendations or tips on how to safely build a routine without irritating my skin? This is my skin texture for reference.

I took a few days to research. I have generally dry skin that’s sensitive with an oily nose with pores on the larger side. In the end I decided on these products:

- Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser
- TirTir Milk Skin Toner light
- Anua 7+ Rice Hydrating Barrier Repair Serum
- CeraVe hydrating lotion, because I never had issues with it

I introduced the new products in a span of 3 days (I know that’s fast but I was just so excited they arrived). In the beginning, I felt great and my skin looked glowy and felt good. Gradually, after 8 days I noticed a few small bumps on the side of my nose, in the height of the under eye area. They’re too small to be pimples and honestly, I’ve never had them before. Research suggested closed comedones (even though I thought I only bought non-comedogenic products) and I decided to stop using all new products except for the cetaphil cleanser because the product list seems so simple and I still wanted to cleanse my face. It’s 4 days later now and the bumps haven’t gone away and even seem to have become more. I’m a little panicked right now. Have any of you had similar experiences with these products before, and what did you do? Could it be the cleanser? Should I stop it right now or give it some more time? Or could this be the after-effects of the other new products? Some help would be greatly appreciated. I would be really sad to not use any of the new products now or to have to buy a lot more just to get rid of this effect.",[Routine Help] Need help as a skincare newbie with possible CCs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1p20pqa/routine_help_need_help_as_a_skincare_newbie_with/,1,Affectionate_Poet522,1,"[Routine Help] Need help as a skincare newbie with possible CCs Hello everyone,

i went to the derm about 2.5 months ago for help regulating extremely oily skin and cystic breakouts on my forehead around my period. i was put on 50mg spiro and 0.025% tret 

since i’ve been taking/using those, my skin is so much worse than its ever been. my chin and cheeks are covered in cystic acne and my forehead is full of closed comedones. my nose is textured too and keeps getting whiteheads. all of these are problems i’ve never experience before. it’s been like this for the past 2 months and the texture isn’t improving and new pimples appear overnight on my nose and cheeks. 

i went back to the derm a few days ago and explained my problems. she upped my spiro to 100mg and gave me a winlevi prescription. i brought up that my skin was genuinely worse than its ever been &amp; how i wasn’t sure if it was just purging or if the spiro or tret was causing breakouts. she simply told me that i could try acutane if i didn’t like results from these products 

im kinda weary of upping the spiro bc idk if that’s what’s causing the horrible chin and cheek breakouts? i’ve also seen rly bad winlevi results so idk what to do. im tempted to just stop everything and let my skin go back to what it used to be bc it was 20x better than how it’s been since starting tret and spiro

i was wondering if other people have experienced breakouts from spiro. and if tret purges caused acne in places you’ve never experienced it before &amp; how long the purges lasted. what would you do in my shoes?

reddit,r/SkincareAddiction,1p1wsac,2025-11-20 07:12:49+00:00,"Hi all!

After digging to no avail I figured my best bet would be to post on here - I am wondering if an intolerance to Azelaic Acid is something that people can have?

My specs are that I am something of a veteran to my skincare - I am 35 and have been caring for my skin since I was a teen. I have infamously bomb proof skin - I use actives and retinal without ever having an issue. I am not acne prone, I am on the dry side, so I make sure to replenish my skin barrier and keep everything hydrated, soothed, sun protected and happy.

All this aside, whenever I go to use anything with Azelaic in it, as I would like to harness the anti-redness properties, my skin goes haywire. Literally a day later, my skin seems bumpy with red dots and a few days later that graduates into full on zits and clogged pores.

I know I'm using it correctly, I know the protocols to take when introducing a new active, but my skin just seems to revolt every time.

After digging to no avail I figured my best bet would be to post on here - I am wondering if an intolerance to Azelaic Acid is something that people can have?

My specs are that I am something of a veteran to my skincare - I am 35 and have been caring for my skin since I was a teen. I have infamously bomb proof skin - I use actives and retinal without ever having an issue. I am not acne prone, I am on the dry side, so I make sure to replenish my skin barrier and keep everything hydrated, soothed, sun protected and happy.

All this aside, whenever I go to use anything with Azelaic in it, as I would like to harness the anti-redness properties, my skin goes haywire. Literally a day later, my skin seems bumpy with red dots and a few days later that graduates into full on zits and clogged pores.

I know I'm using it correctly, I know the protocols to take when introducing a new active, but my skin just seems to revolt every time.

i used the kate somerville anti bac lotion for YEARS. like from the time i was 16 to now (22). it is the product with the best results i've ever seen. now, it's discontinued and i have no clue what to do.

i switched to neutrogena rapid clear acne gel, but i think the benzoyl peroxide is too high. it is 10% while kate somerville was 5%.

(for context, i have also been using neutrogena's hyrdo boost water gel at the ""9x hydration."" it was working very well with the kate somerville lotion for a bit!)

right now, i have deep acne all over my cheeks (and now one on my forehead!) that keeps scarring.

i'm so scared to buy something expensive just for it to not work, or leave my skin worse than it is right now. but i'm so desparate, i have not felt this insecure over my skin since i was in high school.

i would really appreciate if anyone had any advice. i'm a bit useless with skincare and don't know much since i've had the same products mainly for years.

The skin feels bumpy and dry. Is this damaged skin barrier or just needs more exfoliation/fungal acne? My skin type is normal, sometimes a little dry.

My routine (PM):

I sometimes use a cleansing balm;

Kielhs Ultra facial cleanser;

Sometimes a niacinamide serum (Beauty of Joseon glass skin - I started using this earlier this summer so it might have caused the change in my skin but I haven’t been using it lately so I think that would have made a difference);

An hydrating cream, either the inkey list peptide cream (I hated this, I almost finished it and won’t buy it again) or an anti aging cream.

I use the ordinary glycolic acids 2 or 3 times a week, although I’ve stopped using this when I started to suspect that my skin barrier was damaged. 

White spot is mario badescu spot treatment - I also get a few pimples “under” my skin, I don’t know whether to call it cystic acne or not

AM:
Stopped using daily sunscreen in September (I know I should buy it again).  I use an hydrating moisturizer.

(Real quick back story. I got into body skincare and realized vaseline is awesome) So I coated my knees, elbows, butt, feet, and kind of spread it up my leg and some on my arms as well. And I have a warm mist humidifier.

Its a terrible combination apparently. I was tossing and turning so much, not really sleeping but just laying there. It started off with me having very stressful dreams where I couldn't figure something out and tried and tried to figure it out (idk what it was, I was just very stressed)... and then I woke up, still unable to sleep.. so I finally just layed there awake, I felt really moist all over 😆 kind of warm but oddly i didnt feel hot. I finally stood up to use the restroom and that when I felt my heart RACING. I checked my watch and it was 140. I was like wtf! I walked around deep breathing thinking i was just stressed from lack of sleep and finals. And I was just uncomfortable with feeling the vaseline so I washed it off with soap and water. I wasnt feeling any chest pains, dizziness, or fainting spells, so i just treated it as anxiety. Then I chatted with chatGPT and explained what I thought was going and it agreed so I continued deep breathing and made the room way cooler. My heart calmed down in about a 40min time span.

But it took awhile because ya boi was still riding out the adrenaline from overheating.

(Edit: Extra info) I was using a comforter as well. And incase you don't know vaseline is such a thick occlusion that my sweat couldn't evaporate. So (according to my little research with chatGPT 😆) most likely with my body being unable to regulate my temp on its own via sweat evaporation, the heart would compensate and beat faster to push blood to the surface of the skin to let out heat. But with the vaseline trapping in all the heat and preventing my sweat from evaporating, the cycle just continued until I was overheating.

And vaseline is still great, ill just use way less and not use my warm mist humidifier.",psa vaseline made me severely overheat while sleeping idk if this is the sub for this story but i want to put it out there because this specific experience doesnt seem to exist on the internet real quick back story i got into body skincare and realized vaseline is awesome so i coated my knees elbows butt feet and kind of spread it up my leg and some on my arms as well and i have a warm mist humidifier its a terrible combination apparently i was tossing and turning so much not really sleeping but just laying there it started off with me having very stressful dreams where i couldn t figure something out and tried and tried to figure it out idk what it was i was just very stressed and then i woke up still unable to sleep so i finally just layed there awake i felt really moist all over kind of warm but oddly i didnt feel hot i finally stood up to use the restroom and that when i felt my heart racing i checked my watch and it was 140 i was like wtf i walked around deep breathing thinking i was just stressed from lack of sleep and finals and i was just uncomfortable with feeling the vaseline so i washed it off with soap and water i wasnt feeling any chest pains dizziness or fainting spells so i just treated it as anxiety then i chatted with chatgpt and explained what i thought was going and it agreed so i continued deep breathing and made the room way cooler my heart calmed down in about a 40min time span going from 140 gt 136 gt 120something gt 111 gt 106 gt 109 at this point i felt okay to sleep again but it took awhile because ya boi was still riding out the adrenaline from overheating edit extra info i was using a comforter as well and incase you don t know vaseline is such a thick occlusion that my sweat couldn t evaporate so according to my little research with chatgpt most likely with my body being unable to regulate my temp on its own via sweat evaporation the heart would compensate and beat faster to push blood to the surface of the skin to let out heat but with the vaseline trapping in all the heat and preventing my sweat from evaporating the cycle just continued until i was overheating hope this helps someone and vaseline is still great ill just use way less and not use my warm mist humidifier,True

I am 36M and just got treated by a derm for sebaceous adenoma.

He told me it's because I am getting older and there was nothing I could do to prevent this.

He zapped 5 spots with this electric needle and I already feel better about it since they were getting bigger, itchy at times and were localized blatantly on my face.

I know it's going to be an uphill battle from now on if my skin is prone to these types of stuff.

But I still want to mitigate things or just not make things worse.

I am now looking for a routine that can accompany this new information.

I already evade the sun like the plague so there's no worries about sun exposure.

Here are my current products :

Daily sunscreen Biore UV Aqua Rich cream: https://www.biore.com/fr-fr/produits/hydratant-leger-fps-50/

Daily use of Effaclar gel by La Roche Posee at the end of day: https://www.laroche-posay.fr/gammes/visage/effaclar/effaclar-gel-moussant-purifiant-nettoyant-peau-grasse/LRP_050.html#tab=description

I used Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant but it did nothing at all for them. So I am considering cutting it out from my routine. I was using it daily like the packaging said but it made me even more oily and I think that can contribute to the pimples. Sucks I found out after purchasing a very expensive huge bottle of it.

I use L'Oreal Revitalift Vitamin C twice a week: https://www.loreal-paris.fr/soin/soin-par-ingredients/vitamine-c/revitalift-clinical-serum-12--vitamine-c-pure/OAP7229.html

After shaving beard, once a week, I put Nivea Men Sensitive Pro hydrating cream: https://www.nivea.fr/actualites-nivea/sensitive-pro-ultra-apaisant

There are 2 products that I have and don't want to go to waste and was wondering if I should use them:

Paula's Choice Youth extending daily hydrating fluid: https://www.paulaschoice.fr/en/youth-extending-hydrating-fluid-spf-50/m7800.html

Cerave Blemish control gel with AHA and BHA:https://www.cerave.fr/nos-produits/soins-cibles/soin-concentre-anti-imperfections

I had bought them before landing the derm appointment thinking they would make a difference on what I already have. They didn't, but again, the point is to prevent new ones appearing an being kind to my face.

So what do you think about the products I have?

Any recommendations?

reddit,r/eczema,1p27y65,2025-11-20 16:39:53+00:00,"Hello all! 

I wanted to share my story with my eczema. I've been dealing with it off and on for years. Eczema on my hands, elbows, chest, stomach, and neck. One time I had it really bad and my lymph nodes in my neck started swelling so bad that people 10 feet away could see my swollen lymph nodes. 

I was also dealing with stomach issues, headaches, lethargy, irritability, anxiety, and a small bout of depression over the last 8 or so years. 

I finally decided to change some things for me when I recently went back to an urgent care begging for a round of prednisone (one of the few steroids that actually work for me during a bad flare up). The doctor came in and said ""I'll write you a prescription for prednisone, if you promise to do something about this. This is the 7th time you've been to this clinic asking for prednisone in the last 3.5 years.""  
That was a wake up call for me.   
While I was on the prednisone, everything cleared up as expected for me, but as soon as I stopped, the eczema came back on my fingers. Not as bad as before, but it was immediate. Like within 24 hours of stopping the prednisone. 

I've also been browsing this subreddit for years, trying to gain insight on what I could do. My PCP was no help. He would just push triamcinolone cream (which doesn't work for me), and he wouldn't offer any other solutions. 

\-

Here's what worked for me. This is not a blanket statement that everyone else should try, but it's working so far for me. 

1) I ordered a food sensitivity test. I know that they aren't super reliable or super accurate since it's based on a hair sample, but I was hoping it would provide at least some insight into my triggers. It came back and my results indicated that I'm (currently) sensitive to gluten, dairy, apples, bananas, almonds, peanuts, sesame oil, chamomile, and a few other things.   
I immediately cut out all of those things. (It's fall, so cutting out apple cider was a huge bummer for me lol)

2) I started a supplement regimen of:   
Vitamin D3+K2  
Quercetin and Bromelain  
Vitamin C  
Fish Oil  
L-Glutamine  
Fulvic Acid  
Melatonin (20 minutes before bed)

3) I started treating my existing eczema on my fingers.   
I started using hydrocortisone 1% 3-4 times a day on my flares, followed by some beef tallow lotion. (Hydrocortisone doesn't normally do anything for me, but I'm tired of being on steroids, and triamcinolone doesn't work, so it's /something/)  
At night, I would do the same thing, but then wrap it up in a ""wet wrap"" and leave it on overnight. 

4) I started eating super clean. No additives, no preservatives. Just whole foods that were listed as safe in my sensitivity test. So lots of meat, sweet potatoes, rice, vegetables, and fruit (sans apples and bananas). I started drinking some ginger-honey-lemon tea before bed (could no longer drink chamomile tea).   
I also started eating more fermented foods. Fermented pickles, kombucha, etc. 

\-

I'm only 5 days into all of this, and here are the changes I'm seeing:

\-I no longer am addicted to caffeine. Before, I'd have to down two energy drinks and pop a Zyn packet (6mg) just to go to work. I don't have this issue anymore. I've woken up at 5:30 the last 3 mornings ready to go. No caffeine needed. Just some water to get me out the door. 

\-I don't have to run to the bathroom after eating food anymore. (Which was a normal occurrence for me unfortunately)

\-The eczema I do have on my fingers is \~50-60% healed. It's still thick. But it no longer feels raw, or burning. It's only mildly itchy. The color is changing and appears normal from a distance. 

\-I don't have headaches, which was a daily thing for me. I'd basically have to take 400-800mg ibuprofen a day to kill the headaches. 

\-

I'm not saying everyone should do this, I'm just sharing my story. 

I suspect that I probably have some gut issues and that is the core problem I'm dealing with. I'll continue to do this for a few months and order another sensitivity test to see if anything changes, which I suspect that it will since my immune system is probably in overdrive currently. 

Cutting out my food sensitivities, adding in supplements, and treating my existing eczema has worked wonders for me. I feel normal for the first time in probably 7-8 years, and it's only been a week!

I'm bummed about the dairy, the apples, and the bread. But feeling like this makes it all 100% worth it!

",i m healing m 30yo hello all i wanted to share my story with my eczema i ve been dealing with it off and on for years eczema on my hands elbows chest stomach and neck one time i had it really bad and my lymph nodes in my neck started swelling so bad that people 10 feet away could see my swollen lymph nodes i was also dealing with stomach issues headaches lethargy irritability anxiety and a small bout of depression over the last 8 or so years i finally decided to change some things for me when i recently went back to an urgent care begging for a round of prednisone one of the few steroids that actually work for me during a bad flare up the doctor came in and said i ll write you a prescription for prednisone if you promise to do something about this this is the 7th time you ve been to this clinic asking for prednisone in the last 3 5 years that was a wake up call for me while i was on the prednisone everything cleared up as expected for me but as soon as i stopped the eczema came back on my fingers not as bad as before but it was immediate like within 24 hours of stopping the prednisone i ve also been browsing this subreddit for years trying to gain insight on what i could do my pcp was no help he would just push triamcinolone cream which doesn t work for me and he wouldn t offer any other solutions here s what worked for me this is not a blanket statement that everyone else should try but it s working so far for me 1 i ordered a food sensitivity test i know that they aren t super reliable or super accurate since it s based on a hair sample but i was hoping it would provide at least some insight into my triggers it came back and my results indicated that i m currently sensitive to gluten dairy apples bananas almonds peanuts sesame oil chamomile and a few other things i immediately cut out all of those things it s fall so cutting out apple cider was a huge bummer for me lol 2 i started a supplement regimen of vitamin d3 k2 quercetin and bromelain vitamin c fish oil l glutamine fulvic acid melatonin 20 minutes before bed 3 i started treating my existing eczema on my fingers i started using hydrocortisone 1 3 4 times a day on my flares followed by some beef tallow lotion hydrocortisone doesn t normally do anything for me but i m tired of being on steroids and triamcinolone doesn t work so it s something at night i would do the same thing but then wrap it up in a wet wrap and leave it on overnight 4 i started eating super clean no additives no preservatives just whole foods that were listed as safe in my sensitivity test so lots of meat sweet potatoes rice vegetables and fruit sans apples and bananas i started drinking some ginger honey lemon tea before bed could no longer drink chamomile tea i also started eating more fermented foods fermented pickles kombucha etc i m only 5 days into all of this and here are the changes i m seeing i no longer am addicted to caffeine before i d have to down two energy drinks and pop a zyn packet 6mg just to go to work i don t have this issue anymore i ve woken up at 5 30 the last 3 mornings ready to go no caffeine needed just some water to get me out the door i don t have to run to the bathroom after eating food anymore which was a normal occurrence for me unfortunately the eczema i do have on my fingers is 50 60 healed it s still thick but it no longer feels raw or burning it s only mildly itchy the color is changing and appears normal from a distance i don t have headaches which was a daily thing for me i d basically have to take 400 800mg ibuprofen a day to kill the headaches i m not saying everyone should do this i m just sharing my story i suspect that i probably have some gut issues and that is the core problem i m dealing with i ll continue to do this for a few months and order another sensitivity test to see if anything changes which i suspect that it will since my immune system is probably in overdrive currently cutting out my food sensitivities adding in supplements and treating my existing eczema has worked wonders for me i feel normal for the first time in probably 7 8 years and it s only been a week i m bummed about the dairy the apples and the bread but feeling like this makes it all 100 worth it thank you to everyone else who shared their story what works for them and what doesn t work for them in this subreddit you all have been super helpful in guiding me in what to try,True

My eczema came back when I turned 30, it was on my face. I have a few allergies that I think I have under control. I've had a full blood work up &amp; one thing that always get me is that my Eosinophil count is always 
0.94 10*9/L which is basically high but common if you have eczema. 

Anyway, I've noticed that I either get it really bad on my face or really bad on my arms, chest and neck but never in the same place at the same time. So for example, since I've been using proptioc on my face, it's come on my arms, chest and neck. But since I've stopped using protopic (I'm due for light therapy &amp; I've been told to stop protopic as it can interfer with it) it's come back on my face &amp; neck but my arms and chest have started to clear up. 

I'm confused to why it's clearing up everywhere else but just on my face &amp; neck. 

I have OAS ( Oral Allergy Syndrome) and I'm allergic to nuts. I've had patch testing and only nickel came up. 

Another odd one too, when I was ill a few weeks ago, everything cleared up ( I had the lovely sickness and diarrhea bug) but then it came back.

We have two older children (no eczema) and we didn’t change any of our processes , products or diets . We have always ate very clean and used products like Molly Suds and branch basics for regular cleaning and laundry .  Our children have no allergies , are not vaxxed, all born naturally and never on anti-biotics. My wife was breast feeding and we are really stumped. We first tried treating this with topicals , from tallow to desperate main stream social media pitched eczema products (I’m not into slamming companies ) . We saw little to no change simply using topicals , so we took the next step , diet elimination . Over the next few months we saw flare ups come and go , with no real correlation to dairy , egg , gluten , or high histamine foods .  We had our house tested for mold (no mold) , we cleaned and dust regularly so the last thing we thought was maybe our dog (it’s not him either ) . 

I started researching , day and night . Learning about the skin microbiome and its relationship to the gut . Pubmed led me to article after article about dysbiosis , skin acidification and PH . The role of staphylococcus aureus . I found a Reddit post about treating eczema like staph and there was a protocol that we started to follow 

 Day 1-3 was based on staph decolonization and consisted of apple cider vinegar baths , hypochlorus acid spray , and moisturizers . Oral probiotics . 

Within 2 days our child’s skin was healed , it was a miracle. We are actually left wondering if food even played a role . There are certainly foods that promote more alkaline skin - dairy , refined sugars , alcohol , but when we look back we started our child’s life with so many alkaline based products from his soap to his lotion and our naturally hard water . Did we disrupt his skin PH around 1 month and this led to the flare ups and eczema and it wasn’t until we introduced more acidity to his skin he healed ?

Anyone else have this experience ?

We have always ate very clean and used products like Molly Suds and branch basics for regular cleaning and laundry .  Our children have no allergies , are not vaxxed, all born naturally and never on anti-biotics. My wife was breast feeding and we are really stumped. We first tried treating this with topicals , from tallow to desperate main stream social media pitched eczema products (I’m not into slamming companies ) . We saw little to no change simply using topicals , so we took the next step , diet elimination . Over the next few months we saw flare ups come and go , with no real correlation to dairy , egg , gluten , or high histamine foods .  We had our house tested for mold (no mold) , we cleaned and dust regularly so the last thing we thought was maybe our dog (it’s not him either ) .

Background: I have had eczema for as long as I can remember. As a kid and teenager, it was just stubborn patches. As an adult, it began to spread and I used topical steroid after topical steroid until I was using the highest potency. I eventually learned about TSW and got scared because I was definitely abusing topical steroids and not taking breaks. I did a slow taper and then quit them all together. My skin exploded and the eczema spread even worse. I started focusing on diet and vitamin deficiencies. I was able to mostly heal my eczema over the course of a year. I had some stubborn hand and neck eczema but it was mild and manageable. When I became pregnant earlier this year, my eczema healed completely. It was amazing. Now 4-5 months postpartum, and it is back with a vengeance. it is all over my inner arms and around my neck, down my chest, on my eye lids. 

The last month has been terrible. I am flaring about once a week. My skin will become super itchy, red, inflamed, and painful for 2-3 days then dry/ flake, and begin to heal before the next flare up begins. It is truly miserable especially since I just want to be able to take care of my children and be happy. 

So here is what I am currently doing:

\- Strict diet: no gluten (I have Celiac), very limited dairy (mostly just butter or occasional Kefir/ yogurt), no processed sugars or junk food. I make almost all meals at home.   
\- Air filter in room and humidifier at night.               - vacuum bedroom and change bedding frequently (I do have a cat which is why I change bedding and vacuum often)                                                        - Supplements: probiotic, zinc, vitamin D/K, and Omegas daily                                                  - I have only been using Vaseline on my skin as it seems like everything else hurts/burns/makes it worse. I will shower then apply the Vaseline in a thick layer to seal in moisture. It helps until the skin dries out and begin to crack or flake again. It doesn’t feel like my skin is actually healing. 

Obviously, I know this is just a stressful time in my life with being postpartum, caring for my babies, the sleep deprivation, breastfeeding/pumping, etc. There isn’t much I can do about that. It’s just rough because all the things I did last time for healing, don’t seem to be working this time.

I would love help/ your insights!",help me find my trigger i m going crazy trying to figure out my trigger s i m hoping someone else may have some insights background i have had eczema for as long as i can remember as a kid and teenager it was just stubborn patches as an adult it began to spread and i used topical steroid after topical steroid until i was using the highest potency i eventually learned about tsw and got scared because i was definitely abusing topical steroids and not taking breaks i did a slow taper and then quit them all together my skin exploded and the eczema spread even worse i started focusing on diet and vitamin deficiencies i was able to mostly heal my eczema over the course of a year i had some stubborn hand and neck eczema but it was mild and manageable when i became pregnant earlier this year my eczema healed completely it was amazing now 4 5 months postpartum and it is back with a vengeance it is all over my inner arms and around my neck down my chest on my eye lids the last month has been terrible i am flaring about once a week my skin will become super itchy red inflamed and painful for 2 3 days then dry flake and begin to heal before the next flare up begins it is truly miserable especially since i just want to be able to take care of my children and be happy so here is what i am currently doing strict diet no gluten i have celiac very limited dairy mostly just butter or occasional kefir yogurt no processed sugars or junk food i make almost all meals at home air filter in room and humidifier at night vacuum bedroom and change bedding frequently i do have a cat which is why i change bedding and vacuum often supplements probiotic zinc vitamin d k and omegas daily i have only been using vaseline on my skin as it seems like everything else hurts burns makes it worse i will shower then apply the vaseline in a thick layer to seal in moisture it helps until the skin dries out and begin to crack or flake again it doesn t feel like my skin is actually healing obviously i know this is just a stressful time in my life with being postpartum caring for my babies the sleep deprivation breastfeeding pumping etc there isn t much i can do about that it s just rough because all the things i did last time for healing don t seem to be working this time i would love help your insights,True

I’m a 27M and I’ve had diagnosed psoriasis for about 10 years. In the last \~2 years I’ve started getting what seems like eczema in really sensitive areas, my scrotum, armpits, groin folds, etc. When I scratch, the skin gets damaged super easily and it burns like crazy afterwards.

I’ve also been dealing with a tight foreskin and a very dry glans. I’m wondering: **could this all still be psoriasis, or is it eczema?** And why would this suddenly show up after years of having “regular” psoriasis?

For context:

* I walk a lot (15k+ steps a day)
* Gym 2–3x/week
* I stay active overall
* Have ADHD
* Eat reasonably healthy, some sugar here and there
* No major other health issues

This whole thing is making me **really insecure**, especially with dating. Has anyone figured out what causes this or experienced something similar? Any tips, insights, or personal experiences would help a lot.

Apart from the pain, the itching and all hundreds othet symptoms of eczema, the dried skin flakes that fall of my skin are the worst!! I've had a pretty bad flare up since April this year and every day I think it can't get any worse. Then the next day comes and proves me wrong. 

I woke up this morning and when I moved my head I could feel the dry skin flakes from my face falling on my pillow. During the night I woke up several times because my skin was itching, I got up two times to put cream on. Now in the morning I always lay in bed longer than I should and don't move, because I'm scared of moving and getting up. My dry skin will rip open, the skin flakes fall on my bed and I just count the seconds till I can grab the bottle of cream on my night stand. When the cream touches my skin, it burns like hell. But after a minute, I finally get relieve. For like two hours. Then my skin is dried up like a desert again.

I feel like the most disgusting person ever, there are piles of skin flakes and clumps of skin flakes mixed with cream everywhere in my room, no matter how often I vacuum and change my bed sheets (nearly every day). Showering? Impossible. Going swimming? Impossible. My whole day is scheduled to manage my eczema, I carry a bottle of cream everywhere, I even put on cream in the bathroom at my college during breaks. I can't participate in social events if it interrupts my schedule or if my skin hurts too much.

I’ve gone months and years without issue, just to end up in a vicious and unpredictable flare cycle that I can only get under control with prednisone.  I’ve been using topical steroids intermittently all my adult life - more so than I’d like to admit, and I only use moisturizers, soaps, detergents, etc with ingredients I can pronounce. I’ve learned the simpler, the better.  Nonetheless, when my symptoms get bad enough, the only solution that’s worked for me is prednisone.  I’ve considered Dupixent but haven’t yet followed through. 

I recently started seeing a functional medicine doctor to try and identify the root cause of my eczema.  I did a bunch of lab work and will get the results from him Thursday.  I recently completed a 9 day prednisone taper, and a few days later (today) my symptoms returned in full force. I am aware of steroid reliance and withdrawal and I’m sure I’m stuck that cycle.  I’m eager to hear what my doc has uncovered, and also worried about managing symptoms in the short term. I’m wondering if a longer prednisone taper in combination with addressing the root cause of my symptoms via diet, supplements, etc. makes sense? 

Is this a reasonable way to wean off steroids (I would REALLY like to get off them) without ruining one’s quality of life?  Or does it make sense to just rip off the steroid band aid and suffer for a few weeks? Curious to hear how others have navigated steroid use with functional medicine practices.

I’ve got eczema, contact dermatitis, food allergies, and MCAS which all manifest on my skin. I feel like I don’t just walk on eggshells but I live on them, I don’t know how my skin will be within an hour let alone a day. 

My skin has never been normal for about three years, and I’ve found myself lately in a perpetual state of mourning my old self and obsessing over the life I could have had without this. I genuinely feel it’s stopped me from doing so many things, from little things like walking around in shorts in summer to the big stuff like getting married.

I’ve been in one continuous flare now since last September, that’s over a year of hell, and I mean hell. I’m convinced I had TSW, and since then my whole life hasn’t been the same. I can’t eat hardly any foods without it flaring my skin. I was already allergic to milk which cut out a lot of things, but now it’s gluten, soy, corn, chocolate, coffee, sugar. All I want is to eat french bread and butter, that’s it! 

It feels so overwhelming like my world is getting smaller and smaller, and my freedom and the life I want to live is getting further away. All I want to do is wake up of a morning like I used to and have the freedom of wondering “what shall I do today, where shall I go?” Rather than an instant awareness of my body and how it’s going to rule my life that day.

My husband's Eczema came on in his late twenties he's 42 now. And his eczema is as bad as it ever has been. It is generally all over his body, even if he doesn't think it is... It is. It has recently turned into lumps that weep a lot on his arms and legs. And he's just got a general redness about him all over. We've been to the dermatologist but they're not overly helpful and want to stick him on the strongest drug there is (Methotrexate) but it's not something he would want to take. Is there alternatives? 
His family have a history of eczema, his brothers have it or psoriasis. We've tried every cream under the sun, and his mum is very much the natural remedy type.. so it's hard to get him to consider some medications. 
I know he won't be cured, but anything at all to clear it and stop these wounds. 
Note beside.. we do have mold and dust in our residence and we try to keep on top of it. 
The dermatologist can't do allergen patch testing because they said there isn't anywhere on his skin that is clear enough to test. I'm pretty desperate because him scratching and telling me it's getting better has been what I've heard for our whole marriage.. which is 7 years.. yes we joke about the seven year itch 🤣

I’ve tried 2 antibiotics, anti fungals, zinc oxide, zinc powder, vaseline, topical probiotics, E45 and various other moisturisers, Cetroben and other Eczema ointments, anti septic, hypochlorous acid spray and idk how many other things over the months along with changing to simple soaps and unscented body wash.

I started down the mild steroids route and that did seem to help shock it in the weeping stage but I didn’t want to continue down that path.

The only thing that has helped really start to heal the very sorry state of my skin barrier has been creams with multiple ceramides in them. 

I searched this sub for Discoid healing methods and Ceramides came up in some older results. Last week 2 of my hand patches were horribly red and bumpy and now they are fading and healing from the inside out forming the classic discoid healing ring shape.

This won’t help people who can’t use certain products and everyone reacts differently. But if you have Discoid Eczema or any other kind of dry skin Eczema and haven’t tried products with Ceramides in them it’s worth a try.

The biggest difference is trying hard not to scratch ever and slathering the cream on constantly to keep the skin protected. It stings a bit at first but then calms everything and takes away the violent itching. I even bought a smaller pump version to use when I go out.

This might not work forever and I am not sure if it would have done anything in the weeping stage but it’s giving me relief now and maybe more people who try this.","Whoever mentioned Ceramides in this sub, thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1p00e9i/whoever_mentioned_ceramides_in_this_sub_thank_you/,6,curious_tuxedocat,9,"Whoever mentioned Ceramides in this sub, thank you!

reddit,r/eczema,1p008tr,2025-11-18 02:36:00+00:00,"TL;DR: Currently have severe eczema (TSW?), doctor recommending topical steroids, tacrolimus, and/or dupixent. Went cold turkey on steroids and dupixent 2 years ago, and skin completely cleared up. Used some hydrocortisone for 1 week at a time, twice, in the last 3 months, and now have the worst flare I've ever had (35% coverage?). Can't decide if I should use the meds again. The freedom of having no / minor skin issues when my skin was clear for \~ 8 months and not needing any creams or injections made me so happy. 

After using triamcinolone responsibly for \~ 9 years, desonide (on my face) for \~ 1.5 years, and dupixent for a year up to July of 2023, when I cold turkey'd both, I had a gnarly flare from September 2023 - May 2024, then had zero eczema issues until about January 2025.

  
The cold turkey flare was bad. I had trouble sleeping, was constantly in pain / itching, if I started to sweat my nerves would jolt all over my body, I flaked all over like a walking snow machine. So, I ate clean, took Dead Sea salt baths, took a probiotic, used a black tea washcloth on my face, moisturized with beef tallow / vanicream / amlactin, and used DHS tar shampoo to help with flaky scalp. I think it helped? Then I finally got better. No issues with my skin for about 8 months. No steroids. No dupixent. Would sometimes even shower without moisturizing after. Life was good. 

  
Then, got a new job. My new job involved me being outdoors, in pants, hot and humid, wearing a helmet, constantly stressed and sweating. So, an eczema patch came back on my forehead. My skin continued to get a little worse over the course of a few months, so when I met a girl, naturally, I used a little hydrocortisone for the first time in 1 year for 1 week. Then used it for 1 week again 1 month after that. Luckily, I quit that old job and have a new, remote job so I can control my environment much better. 

Then onset the new flare. To date, this is the worst flare I've ever had. My face is flaking then not flaking some days, and almost the whole rest of my body is red and kinda flaky. I haven't had a restful sleep for almost 2 months. Always waking up scratching, always itchy throughout the day. I have what appears to be the ""red sleeves"" most people with TSW say they get. IDK if this is severe eczema or TSW, but it has never been this bad in my life.

Anyway, I'm in a real tough spot.

I think my dermatologist thinks I am crazy for not using steroids or jumping on dupixent, but the last time I used dupixent, the conjunctivitis was pretty damn bad, and I'd still get small flares on my face, so I'd rather have a shot at not having any issues by just using no drugs, and getting through this flare.

Went cold turkey on steroids and dupixent 2 years ago, and skin completely cleared up. Used some hydrocortisone for 1 week at a time, twice, in the last 3 months, and now have the worst flare I've ever had (35% coverage?). Can't decide if I should use the meds again. The freedom of having no / minor skin issues when my skin was clear for \~ 8 months and not needing any creams or injections made me so happy. 

After using triamcinolone responsibly for \~ 9 years, desonide (on my face) for \~ 1.5 years, and dupixent for a year up to July of 2023, when I cold turkey'd both, I had a gnarly flare from September 2023 - May 2024, then had zero eczema issues until about January 2025.

  
The cold turkey flare was bad. I had trouble sleeping, was constantly in pain / itching, if I started to sweat my nerves would jolt all over my body, I flaked all over like a walking snow machine. So, I ate clean, took Dead Sea salt baths, took a probiotic, used a black tea washcloth on my face, moisturized with beef tallow / vanicream / amlactin, and used DHS tar shampoo to help with flaky scalp. I think it helped? Then I finally got better. No issues with my skin for about 8 months. No steroids. No dupixent. Would sometimes even shower without moisturizing after. Life was good.

I started developing eczema during 2020 on my hands and it’s usually at its worst during winter.

But this year it’s started showing on my face, and I’m at a loss on what to do. 

I’m getting dark red itchy patches under my chin and around my eyes, and it’s driving me insane tbh.

The cause is definitely environmental, and I don’t want to go to the doctor’s yet because if I’m honest- I feel guilty for taking up the time- NHS patients life 💀


I’m wondering- to my fellow environmental sufferers- how you guys manage these symptoms and flare ups? 

What works for you and how can I be more preventative in the future?


Right now I have started a routine:

-Wash face- softly with no harsh chemicals.
-Warm compress- helps the itching and I have no swelling.
- Eurax or Sudacrem- something to soothe the itching.
- light moisturiser on the rest of my face 
- Vaseline on affected areas to lock in moisture- once the Eurax has been absorbed. 


I do this twice a day. Morning and night. But top up the Vaseline as needed. 

I don’t really know what I’m doing, but this little routine seems to be providing some relief. I just haven’t a clue if it’s good for my skin.

I’ve been diagnosed with psoriasis for over 10 years now. Initially it was very manageable, little coverage across my scalp that would disappear for months on end with a simple course of medicated shampoo.
Fast forward a few years later, I’ve been on medicated shampoo for 3/4 years consistently and the symptoms are worsening. I have thick flakes that extend around my ears, in my ears, neck and hairline. Around the ears are very painful, weeping and bleeding. 
Come on here out of desperation because my ears are now blocked with psoarisis. They’re inflamed inside and they’re tender to touch. Not infected, just fucked.
Looking for some recommendations as my dermatology appointment is looking to be in 2/3 years time.

Ketoconazole
Polytar

Betamethasone
Clobetasone

I was diagnosed with psoriasis in July 2023 and my dermatologist sucks for reference lol, it takes 4 months to get an appointment and he only spends 2 minutes with me each time. He did nothing to help me treat it, I got betaderm from my family doctor and found everything else from this sub. So thank you guys for that &lt;3 I thought I'd share what I did and some before and after photos (although I don't have many before photos because I reached a point where I couldn't even bear to look at myself). 

I bought a 6 bulb solarc device that shipped to Vancouver in 3 or 4 days, it was very quick and the customer service is fantastic. Shout out to them! What a life changing machine. After about 3 weeks and using it 3x a week, my skin has healed for the most part (photos below), along with betaderm and some other things which really made difference. 

**Routine:** 

**- La roche posay lipikar shower cleansing oil - DO NOT USE A LOOFAH OR BODY WASH GUYS. I just use my hands to rub this in because a loofah or anything similar to it is too harsh and will only irritate your psoriasis more. Do not use anything with sulphates or chemical exfoliants.** 

**- Solarc 6 bulb device 3x a week - do it after the shower on clean skin, I'm at 4:30 per side (4 sides - front, back and each side of my body)** 

**- Betaderm 1-2x daily at night: I know this sub isn't always too supportive of topicals but I noticed a difference when I didn't use it, but I also tested not doing phototherapy and only using betaderm which also didn't work as effectively by itself. I got the best results doing both. Use betaderm after phototherapy.** 

**- Zinc cream I got on amazon - use after betaderm 1x day: I was roasted in the sub when I linked it last time (lmao I swear I'm not affiliated) so I'm not gonna link it here but I'm pretty sure any similar cream will do. This cream made a MASSIVE difference in helping flatten the marks without needing to descale, and has been helping a lot with the hyperpigmentation left behind. When I use it after betaderm (apply both before bed), I wakeup the next day with flat marks. When I wasn't using it, they were still less red but not flat and not descaled even after trying Urea. I cannot emphasize enough how much this helped me, seriously. And it's affordable, as someone who's lived through poverty I wouldn't recommend someone spend money on something that doesn't work, but this really helped me personally.** 

**- Cutting out alcohol and sugar - alcohol is absolutely a trigger for me (I tested it), so I cut it out of my diet which I'm pretty happy about. I also noticed refined sugars had the same effect, so cut those out too, but I do enjoy both in very very limited quantities once or twice a week. I've been trying to drink more water, workout and lose some weight, all of which has made a difference in my self-esteem at the very least. I figured might as well be fit if I have to live with this on my skin, since my confidence has taken a big hit. I recommend this to anyone struggling with the mental aspect of psoriasis, and getting healthier can will help even if it doesn't fix the problem (since I know there's a debate about the psoriasis diet and whether it actually helps).** 

I still have hyperpigmentation as you can see but it is rapidly fading each day and I don't think any of it will be permanent, but I'm going to see my family doctor tomorrow to check in. Also, my derm's office cancelled my appointment for January without telling me since I stopped doing phototherapy at the clinic (I told the receptionist that but I guess she didn't leave a note in my file), and when I called and told them I got a Solarc device they said ""oops well we gave your spot away guess you'll have to come back in march. I'm so disappointed in them and idk part of me feels like it has to do with how some doctors don't take women's health concerns seriously, but thankfully I have an amazing family doctor. They didn't even know what the Solarc devices were though.....yikes. My insomnia and depression are back though, so that really sucks, and I'm back on sleeping pills and benzos. I've also been coping with weed, tbh. I've spent thousands of dollars trying to deal with this problem, and have lost thousands of dollars  because it fucked up my skin so bad. I am very upset, and hate having to deal with more problems on top of the million problems I already have to deal with.

But I really hope this helps someone out there. This is all stuff I tested in a way that I know each step made a difference. Of course everyone's skin is different but perhaps  those with darker skin tones will find this helpful. Thank you to this sub too because I only learned all this stuff from you guys!!!

reddit,r/psoriasis,1p0flkr,2025-11-18 15:56:39+00:00,"I'm a bit overwhelmed, and I'm currently having a major flare up. My method to treat it has been a mix of biologics (cosentyx) and topical cream (Zoreyv and clobetasal).
Now the treatment has been fine for the the first few months, but I still would have some coverage. I tried bringing this up in my dermatology appointments in the early months but my doctor insisted that the biologics need more time to take full effect and suggested that I use the cream more often. 
The Zoreyv cream has really helped reduce the over all inflammation and I had been using that a lot. But two months ago I tried to refill my prescription and was told that I was ordering the prescription too soon. That this cream is supposed to me a 60 day supply and that I should have been using only one gram per day. So I ended up having to wait a month before getting this very specific cream and because of the wait it feels like my psoriasis has gotten worse.
To top it off it missed my cosentyx injection by a week came my doctor failed to refill the prescription in time.
I was in so much pain yesterday that I scared myself with my first suicidal thought in 5 years. I need something to change. I have a TB test at the dermatology office today and I can feel like I'm going to have a lot to say to the receptionist but I technically won't see a doctor that appointment.

That this cream is supposed to me a 60 day supply and that I should have been using only one gram per day. So I ended up having to wait a month before getting this very specific cream and because of the wait it feels like my psoriasis has gotten worse.
To top it off it missed my cosentyx injection by a week came my doctor failed to refill the prescription in time.
I was in so much pain yesterday that I scared myself with my first suicidal thought in 5 years. I need something to change. I have a TB test at the dermatology office today and I can feel like I'm going to have a lot to say to the receptionist but I technically won't see a doctor that appointment. I feel like I definitely need to get my dermatologist appt pushed up but that could take a month before I see them. What could I reason do or ask for?",i m not sure what action i need to take going forward i m a bit overwhelmed and i m currently having a major flare up my method to treat it has been a mix of biologics cosentyx and topical cream zoreyv and clobetasal now the treatment has been fine for the the first few months but i still would have some coverage i tried bringing this up in my dermatology appointments in the early months but my doctor insisted that the biologics need more time to take full effect and suggested that i use the cream more often the zoreyv cream has really helped reduce the over all inflammation and i had been using that a lot but two months ago i tried to refill my prescription and was told that i was ordering the prescription too soon that this cream is supposed to me a 60 day supply and that i should have been using only one gram per day so i ended up having to wait a month before getting this very specific cream and because of the wait it feels like my psoriasis has gotten worse to top it off it missed my cosentyx injection by a week came my doctor failed to refill the prescription in time i was in so much pain yesterday that i scared myself with my first suicidal thought in 5 years i need something to change i have a tb test at the dermatology office today and i can feel like i m going to have a lot to say to the receptionist but i technically won t see a doctor that appointment i feel like i definitely need to get my dermatologist appt pushed up but that could take a month before i see them what could i reason do or ask for,True

I’ve dealt with mild psoriasis for about 10 years now, mostly in the “classic” spots like knees, elbows, etc. I know many people have it much worse, but it still wears me down and I’ve been trying to find something that actually helps in a lasting way.

Dermatologists always gave me the same solution: steroid cream. It works a bit, but only temporarily, and I always feel like the flare comes back stronger afterward.

A few months ago I came across home UVB therapy and decided to try it. I’m using the **Dermfix 1000MX EU (narrowband UVB 311 nm)**. I followed the guidelines very carefully, and honestly, the results shocked me. Nothing else I’ve used has ever cleared my skin this effectively.  


I added an image showing my log with dates, exposure times, and a rating system (1 = clear, 6 = worst). I’d really appreciate your thoughts on a few things:

* Does my routine look reasonable to you?
* How long do you usually take a break between cycles?
* My improvements don’t last very long before things slowly return. Has anyone else noticed the same?

I’ve been on steroid creams/tablets over the early years but wanted to avoid these as had negative side effects so ended up doing a few courses of phototherapy think the last one I just finished a month ago would be my 5th course over the last 5/6 years.

Within a few weeks of finishing my phototherapy which did actually almost clear my psoriasis it’s came back with vengeance and I can’t seem to calm it I currently use Exorex lotion and Epimax cream.

Whenever I see the dermatologist they want me to go on to methotrexate but I’m nervous about this as when I’ve researched it the side effects and potential issues in the long term make me anxious and wonder if it’s worth it.

Since reading this Reddit I’ve discovered about the biologics, just wanted to know people’s experiences with methotrexate and also if people have managed to get onto a biologic in the UK NHS without going through methotrexate?

Also what’s people’s opinions on the creams I currently use if there was any better options out there

Then these small itchy spots started showing up on my body and I also got sick with a viral infection a month after my scalp psoriasis became worseprobably (didn't get it checked though) it went away after a week, since then I have a fairly mild to moderate amount of spots on my legs, back, stomach, face and some sort of psoriasis in my ears. Any idea how long this will last? or if it will go away at all? it has been like 2 and a half  months, i don't really know if it is healing as some of the spots are smaller than before and some are worse, and my scalp is still pretty bad, I've been taking antibiotics this past week cause the doc prescribed them and when I take them their is no itching, however I missed them on a day and there was itching on my legs again. I was also diagnosed with sinusitis this month, but I always get this too during winters so I was not too worried about it.
Overall, this has been affecting my mental health pretty badly, I don't know what is really causing it, if it's a bacterial infection or a viral infection, stress, diet or whatever. My lifestyle has been pretty bad in general this year, I don't know if it's gonna heal at all, the place where I live doesn't really have readily available UVB therapy, I do try to sunbathe every alternate though, which helps a little.
It's not too severe right now, the spots don't cover a lot of body and some of them are pretty small, somedays I feel like it's healing, other days I feel like it's getting worse again, I am pretty confused if this is gonna get better or not.

My immune system kind of came back online and went on overdrive. I have the psoriasis at a 3 now that I’m on topicals and proper shampoos. It was raging pretty hard before that.

The game changer was cutting out dairy though. Huge improvements that I couldn’t get with topicals alone. But when I made that dietary shift, all of my joints flared up. That happened to me during post partum before. I took estrogen and it cleared it up about 80%. 

All this to say, the joint stuff is making my dermatologist strongly suggest going on Tremfya. She said get ahead of the arthritis now. I didn’t think that was the correct diagnosis so I saw a rheumatologist. They did some blood and xrays and I don’t have anything pointing to PsA. 

TLDR- do I have anything to lose by going on tremfya and just seeing how I feel? I dont want to mess with my immune system if I dont need to.

I’m a 27-year-old female and have been on biologics (TALTZ) for the past eight months. My dermatologist recently advised me to stop TALTZ if we are planning for a baby, and to wait for about two months before trying to conceive.

My main concern is the possibility of a psoriasis flare-up once I stop the biologic. I’ve heard from some people that pregnancy can actually reduce flare-ups, and that many women don’t experience flare-ups during pregnancy.

For those who have gone through this:
	•	Did your psoriasis flare up after stopping biologics when trying for a baby?
	•	How did your symptoms behave during pregnancy?
	•	What was your experience post-delivery — did you have a flare-up, and how severe was it?
	•	If you needed treatment after delivery, did it affect breastfeeding in any way?

Are there any certain diagnostic things that would tell me it’s psoriasis?",mom looking for answers when my daughter was 11 12 she started getting these greasy chunks on her scalp they were hard to the touch and her scalp would bleed if she picked them off it seemed to have shown up overnight at the first derm visit they said she had psoriasis but then a few months later we came back and they said it was seborrheic dermatitis in addition to her scalp she gets flakes on her eyebrows and the crease of her nose and under her bottom lip gets rashy she occasionally gets angry red patches on her inner elbows i m at a loss because we ve tried so many scalp treatments shampoos ointments and currently attempted a diet change so hard for a teenager i m at the point where i wonder if it s actually psoriasis it flares up as soon as she s back in school but summertime her skin and scalp is fine when i google image search psoriasis i see pictures of big silvery white patches and hers have never quite looked like that at its most severe it was yellowy greasy plaques on her scalp it often just appears as a very flaky scalp and sometimes there is redness too my heart hurts for her because she s so self conscious about this i just wish i could fix this are there any certain diagnostic things that would tell me it s psoriasis,True

Need some advice if someone has gone through something similar. 

Im a 35 year old male. I have had psoriasis since I was 17. Luckily for me its not on my skin except my sclap, however, my PsA is quite bad in both my hands and feet. 

During these last 5 to 8 months my PsA has taken a turn for the worst. I wear formal shoes to work and have started getting severe pain in my left foot toes every time I take a step. I have been to my rheumatologist who put me on salazopyrin (built up to twice in the morning and twice at night) together with 1 celebrex in the morning and 1 at night. 

My foot has gotten worse with pain above my heel and now my knee is so bad and painful. In a space of 3 months I now limp and walk, cannot jog or run at all as my leg feels like its going to buckle and break. 

During the last month my rheumatologist has added methotrexate to my meds, which I take 3 on a saturday night in conjunction with the salazopyrin. I used to take methotrexate 15 years ago but stopped as it made me feel sick 

During these last 3 weeks I have had 2 scary setbacks which I wanted to know if anything like this happend to anyone else. On november 1st, I woke up and my tounge was numb and I was shaky and had no power in my legs, I honestly thought I was going to die. I got rushed to hospital and they ran blood tests, did an ECG and Chest X rays but found nothing except that inflammation in my blood was around 9.2.

The doctor at the hospital says that I could of had a panic attack, which I have never had before. I called my rheumatologist and told him, he says for now I must continue my meds as normal. 

Last night I had the same attack again, I am at a point now where I just dont know what is happening and its so scary. 

Has anyone had anything similar happen? 

I am not on biologics or anything else. 

Please advise if you can.

i went to the dermatologist this week and she just said oh yes thats apart of rosacea. she prescribed me ivermectin and a sulfur wash. im waiting for my pharmacy to get them in stock.

I'm hoping someone might have an idea about this weird skin issue I'm experiencing.

Every once in a while, and seemingly out of nowhere, a single red patch appears on my right cheek. It's about 1 cm (a little under half an inch) in diameter.

The strangest part is that it visibly intensifies and becomes much redder when I clench my jaw. After some time it eventually fades away again. It's not painful or itchy, just... there.

Has anyone ever experienced something like this or have any clue what it could be? I'm planning to see a doctor, but wanted to see if someone might have any insights first.

After about 4 or 5 months of returning to the dermatologist they stopped scheduling follow ups and just asked me whether or not the medication I had been using for the past 4-5 weeks was working or not. When it wasn't they would just prescribe something else, usually not even asking for pictures. They have not confirmed that it's Rosacea, but all the symptoms seem to fit, and they also haven't seen me in person over the last 6 months. When all else has failed they recommended a 6 month Accutane treatment. Have people had success treating PP Rosacea with Accutane? It feels extreme, particularly given that I am only impacted right around my nose.

Here are the medications that we've tried, I think this is all of them:
- Ketoconazole 2%
- Tretinoan 0.025% and 0.05%
- Tacrolimus Ointment 0.1%
- Metronadizole 0.75%
- Mupirocin 2%

My skin care routine without any of the prescription meds that we've been rotating through involves:
AM
- Water rinse
- Naturium Azelaic Acid 10%
- Aveeno Daily Moisturizer

PM
- Water rinse
- Proactive Clean Sulfer Acne Cleanser
- Water rinse

But the problem is that my skin feels extremely tight and uncomfortable when I don’t use any moisturizer. It’s like my skin barrier feels even worse: tightness, and that constant “pulled” feeling. So I end up stuck between:

Soolantra alone = fewer pustules
Adding moisturizer = more comfort but more breakouts

I’ve been using generic ivermectin on and off for a couple of years. When I was first diagnosed, I used Soolantra, but couldn’t afford $450 every few months, so my dermatologist switched me to generic ivermectin. I’ve also been taking doxycycline 50mg daily for a few years. (I stopped for about 6 months, then got terrible flareups, so my derm wants me to be on it long term).

My pustules come and go, leaving ice pick like scars. Lately, my skin’s been under control, with no major flare-ups for months. But last week, I got three painful, inflamed pustules on my cheeks.

I started spot-treating them with ivermectin(I had to use it every other day due to damaged skin barrier, which I’m sure everyone can relate), and after two days, one of them developed two tiny holes. It made me wonder, has this been happening all along, and I just never noticed? The holes are very small; you really have to look closely.

I’m also wondering if ivermectin might be less effective after years of use, or if switching from Soolantra to generic has caused these scars? I remember Soolantra was super effective.

Has anyone else experienced this?

reddit,r/rosacea,1ozu0i1,2025-11-17 22:08:27+00:00,"Hi all

I suffer from type 1 rosacea and have very oily, possibly dehydrated skin. I’m talking an oil slick an hour after cleansing and constantly dabbing at my face with blotting paper to combat it. So far I’ve managed to keep the oiliness mostly under control with Niacinamide (a god send!), and Azelaic Acid seems to be calming down the redness a bit, as well as having a slightly mattifying finish which is nice. I’m also repairing my skin barrier with LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 at night.

I’m looking for a good SPF to use during the day that isn’t going to make me look shiny. My rosacea is persistant redness and products that make the skin look glassy don’t work for me, it’s like a spotlight highlighting my red areas.

I need something that’s going to sink into the skin creating a matte finish, preferably hydrating as I believe my skin to be dehydrated which is why it’s so oily. I’ve read that gel products are better as they’re not as thick as creams.

Also, is it ok to skip moisturiser and just use SPF during the day as I’ve heard that it can be used in place of a moisturiser? I’m trying to use the least amount of products possible as my skin is extremely sensitive and gets irritated easily.

I suffer from type 1 rosacea and have very oily, possibly dehydrated skin. I’m talking an oil slick an hour after cleansing and constantly dabbing at my face with blotting paper to combat it. So far I’ve managed to keep the oiliness mostly under control with Niacinamide (a god send!), and Azelaic Acid seems to be calming down the redness a bit, as well as having a slightly mattifying finish which is nice. I’m also repairing my skin barrier with LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 at night.

I’m looking for a good SPF to use during the day that isn’t going to make me look shiny. My rosacea is persistant redness and products that make the skin look glassy don’t work for me, it’s like a spotlight highlighting my red areas.

I’ve dealt with rosacea since I was a kid, but never bothered me that much - until I had a bad flare up reaction to an antibiotic I had to use post surgery a few years ago. Then it got worse and worse, and my usual routine (which was a very basic moisturizer, gentle cleaning and sunscreen) just stopped working a few months ago.

So I got enough and went to see a dermatologist a month ago, and was prescribed soolantra - which seems to be a classic on this thread. Got kinda better from the overall flare, but still bad.

But aside from the actual bumps, pustules and redness - which are already bad and gives me major sensory overload -, I’ve been just feeling very depressed. Like this is never going away and that’s my life now - look ugly and sensory overwhelmed. Every other cream and sunscreen I tried (that derm recommended) seems to make things worse. So I’ve been living like a vampire, not going out during the day to avoid having to apply sunscreen. Only using moisturizer and soolantra at night. And washing with a gentle soap.

Does it get better? Does anyone else have extremely reactive skin and got better eventually? Does sometimes you just want to sit and cry but are also scared that crying will make it worse? lol

In my late 40s, it spread to my forehead and I sometimes get spots on my cheeks and even on my eyelids (maybe demodex or histamine response?). 

I suspect the spread is hormone related, and I sometimes wonder if it’s truly rosacea on my forehead or something else. 

Here’s the issue I was hoping for some insight about: I used to be able to use any product I wanted without my skin going crazy and had glowing skin. For the past three years, I’m scared to try new products and have lost my glow. 

Right now, I only use Avene’s gentle cleanser at night, Tower 28 SOS Barrier moisturizer morning and night and Tower 28 tinted sunscreen during the day. 

Has anyone discovered a gentle routine that makes your skin glow without causing a flare up?

She prescribed me triple cream, Rhofade, and said only v beam will really help with blood vessels and redness (im not going to use the Rhofade because I’m scared of rebound and it’s a temp fix anyway)
She also gave me some samples of EltaMD UV daily and UV recovery green tinted SPF. I tried the UV daily yesterday and it surprisingly didn’t give me a reaction. Going to try the UV recovery today. SPF always gives me a bunch of red marks or pills so I’ve been avoiding them. 
When she asked if I had any questions I kind of went blank and said no. Now regretting that because I don’t know if my skincare routine is okay once I start the cream. 

I have combo skin and my routine is currently

 AM- cerave hydating facial cleanser 
Cetaphil daily hydrating lotion or trying the EltaMD if I plan on leaving the house. I also never wear makeup. 

PM -the same as AM minus an spf and I use the cerave hydrating alcohol free toner before moisturizing.
I was using Cetaphil Gentle exfoliating SA cleanser at night but stopped about 2 weeks ago because I read that SA can cause problems for rosacea. 

Is this routine okay? Should I apply the triple cream before or after moisturizer? I’ve seen women online moisturizing first then applying the cream but also read it’s supposed to go on before moisturizer. Will I purge when starting the cream? 
Can I go back to using the SA cleanser at night while using the triple cream? 
I feel so confused by all of this and really should have asked her and didn’t want to schedule again just to ask her this. 
I’m due back in two months to check progress with the cream.

reddit,r/rosacea,1oxhdru,2025-11-15 03:35:14+00:00,"Hey everyone, for like a year now I've been dealing with facial redness that I'd never experienced before, it all started after I was using Tretinoin for acne and getting a lot of intentional sun exposure for weeks and months on end with no sunscreen, stupid I know. I'm 29M by the way. 

I had stopped Tret and stopped going in the sun, my face was still red, but over time just focusing on gentle constant moisturizing and hydrating, basically barrier repair. Very slowly has my face become less red, but still there is this underlying general pinkness, like the skin everywhere on my body is healthy and normal, but then my face is a little darker and a little more red than the rest of my skin anywhere else, also it's really reactive to new products and certain ingredients.

Doxycycline makes any redness basically go away, which indicates to me that it is at least some form of inflammation. Triggers seem to be lack of sleep or exhaustion, not drinking enough water, stress, anxiety, basically any emotional response, and sitting weirdly enough. Redness/pinkness is basically everywhere on the face except around the eyes.

I finally saw a dermatologist today in person and told him how I never had any issues with redness until after I was using Tret and getting regular prolonged sun exposure, that an online dermatologist said I had rosacea, a different one said it was a damaged skin barrier, he said he thinks it's rosacea and that the Tret triggered it all. I still don't know, because I thought rosacea was more limited to around the center of the face, not the entire face, Azelaic Acid just makes my face more red and irritated even with the sandwich method, and barrier repair seems to have been working albeit very gradually, I don't have any visible broken blood vessels either, basically I have none of the typical rosacea hallmarks other than a pink face that flushed red easily. Any amount of niacinamide also seems to make my skin much more red almost immediately. 

He also said that rosacea is incurable and that the redness will never fully go away. That's pretty crushing, I hope it's not true of course, I just don't understand how a couple months of Tretinoin with sun exposure could bring forth a brand new lifelong problem like this. Surely eventually the damage can be undone with enough time and/or the right treatment and this stupid redness can be reversed, right??

He prescribed me Avar cleanser, Azelaic Acid 15% gel, Metro gel 0.75%, and Doxycycline 100mg. He wants me to jump right into AA mornings and Metro at night, I mean, I'm willing to try it since he's the professional, but I'm fairly positive that going from a sensitive skin safe moisturizing routine with 0 actives to sulfur, AA, and Metro all at once is going to turn my not so bad now skin into a pool of lava.

But since this change I've been breaking out with little red spots and the left side of my face is flushing a lot more. The only thing ive changed is my diet.

reddit,r/rosacea,1ow4mz3,2025-11-13 15:52:24+00:00,"I’m still in complete disbelief. Ever since I was a teen, whenever I get anxious or stressed, my face, neck, and chest become red. Like, *really red*. And it’s not just a red glow, it’s a blotchy splash that looks like I’m having an alarming medical emergency. I have worked with primary care providers, psychiatrists, and specialists tackling this issue from a neurological perspective. Tried therapy with nearly every available anti-anxiety med and anti-depressant available with no luck. My PCP even referred me to Mayo Clinic about it as he was stumped, but they denied my referral as they determined they wouldn’t be able to help me based on my pre-screen info. So I’ve just been living with it, wearing high cut shirts and turtlenecks, missing the days of being able to hide behind a face mask and mostly avoiding social interactions and people as a whole. 

Of course, I have other triggers too- drinking any amount of alcohol, even a sip of wine or even NyQuil, causes me to break out in this same red rash. My doctors and I thought this might be separate from the psychological/neuro aspects of the flushing, possibly just Alcohol Flush Reaction. My face also becomes red when I exercise, take hot showers, or am outside when it’s cold- something I thought was totally normal for a person with “sensitive” skin. The point is, I/we never once thought to connect the dots here, thinking all these triggers are brought on by separate systems and thus separate issues. 

Recently, seemingly out of nowhere, I developed a condition called Recurrent Corneal Erosion. This condition causes the surface of my eye to fuse to my eyelid while I’m asleep, and once I wake up and open my eyes, it tears off the top layer of my eyeball. Insanely painful- feels like there’s a glass shard in my eye with nonstop irritation for up to two weeks. I actually have to take off work for the first couple of days when this happens as I literally can’t see/my eye is red and swollen and constantly producing tears. No effective pain medications are available. 

In my efforts to try and find methods to prevent it from happening, I stumbled upon a discussion in this subreddit where someone mentioned their treatment for ocular rosacea has immensely helped their own RCE. A minute later, I find myself scrolling through this sub and pictures and… holy FUCK. People who have the SAME exact experience as me?! I never once met anyone else in my entire life who flushes when anxious, gets blotchy when drinking, etc.. and yet here you all are!

I told my PCP that I suspected my lifelong issue might simply be rosacea and asked for a referral to a derm. In the derm’s office about a week ago, she walked in, looked at me for maybe 5 seconds, and said “oh yeah, you have a very classic case of ETR rosacea” (followed by confirming a rough skin texture by lightly touching my face- note that I have never had acne or issues with pimples but she did say my face felt rough). No comment on the RCE as I’m not actively having any kind of ocular episode. 

I’m now almost a week into her prescribed treatment- Rhofade once in the morning and Soolantra twice a day. I have an appointment for an IPL laser treatment soon. The samples of Rhofade I used before starting Soolantra seemed to help slightly but did not entirely eliminate my redness. Hard to say with the Rhofade now, as the Soolantra has caused me to break out in itchy red bumps all over my face and neck. From what I’ve read, this is a normal part of the process and Rhofade probably won’t help with the initial Soolantra side effects. I’ve also read about adverse reactions/worsening redness people have with Rhofade. However, I plan to stick it out and just follow up with my derm. (What’s funny is that I have been to a derm exactly once before for a different issue and they said nothing about my rosacea at the time)

Anyway, the point of my story is to say THANK YOU to everyone who was brave enough to talk about their condition, post pictures, and help others. Now that I actually know what I’m dealing with, I feel like much less of a medical anomaly and am looking forward to trying treatments that will actually work. More importantly, I feel much less alone. My hope is that anyone with undiagnosed rosacea looking up their symptoms or reading stories might get a nudge in the potentially right direction if their experiences are similar to mine.

1. Gentle cleanser- I started using Cetaphil’s gentle face cleanser, but somehow it made my skin more prone to acne. I felt that this cleanser wasn’t able to clean the dirt and oil properly.

2. Ivermectin- I applied Ivermectin for about 4-5 weeks, but didn’t see any improvements. It make my skin oily which caused acne, and made my face red.

3. Neutrogena face moisturizer- I felt this wasn’t moisturizing enough, and make my cheeks flaky.

4. Vanicream face moisturizer- Made my skin oily and prone to acne.

Products that worked:

1. Neutrogena salicylic acid face wash- cleaned my pores thoroughly.

2. Sulfur soap- worked like magic. Ever since I started using this, the acnes and acne bumps started reducing. Because the soap is harsh, I only use it once a day in the evenings.

3. La Roche-Posay Toleraine double face moisturizer- I swear by this product!! My skin stopped flaking, and at the same time it isn’t that oily to create acne. My skin loves it.

4. The Ordinary Azelaic acid- Helps make my skin smooth, and gets rid of tiny acne bumps or white heads

I originally went to the pharmacy because I had some bad acne pimples that left dark scars. I also had an older hyperpigmentation spot that I could never fix.

The pharmacist gave me this cream called Melanofree 4%. I started using it, and honestly the results were crazy. Within one week my acne marks faded fast, and that old hyperpigmentation spot is now about 95% lighter.

Only later I checked the ingredients and realized it's a triple combination cream:

Hydroquinone 4%

Tretinoin 0.05%

Fluocinolone (a mild steroid)


Now my question is:

Can this be used long-term?
Because it works extremely well for me, but I’ve heard that hydroquinone and steroids shouldn’t be used forever. I don’t want to damage my skin while trying to fix it.

I have been using Tretinoin for about 6 weeks now, 5 of which I did every other night.

My routine:
AM: 
LRP Toleraine Face Wash (no actives)
Finacea 15% 
Vanicream Facial Ceramide Cream
LRP Toleraine moisturizer with SPF

Occasionally I’ll switch to Panoxyl Benzoyl 10% to wash if my skin doesn’t feel compromised at all because it has had some great results

PM:
LRP Toleraine Face Wash
Tret .05 pea sized amount spread evenly everywhere, but under and around eyes ( I was applying to my nose and bridge which I suppose is close to the eyes though)
Wait an hour then Finacea 15% again (sometimes I’ll skip morning or night if I feel any sort of irritation)
Wait 30 minutes then moisturize with vanicream

I have haruharu Wonder black rice probiotic toner I use occasionally (not really sure where to fit it in the routine)
I also have COSRX snail mucin I use occasionally I’m also not sure where to use that in my routine.
I use LRP Cicaplast balm B5 maybe once a week just to kinda help my skin barrier maintain.

Back to the main topic, I did a bit of research and did see a couple other people have this nosebleed issue. Pretty much the general response was that it couldn’t be the tret and had to be dry air, but it started a couple days after I started using nightly. Hopefully changing the application will help with this, and maybe someone else has experienced this and can offer insight. I will report back after stopping tret on the upper part of the nose. I also ordered taz and am considering giving that a try at some point.

When should I use the probiotic or the snail mucin? I was also considering adding a vitamin C serum or some more hydrating serums/toners - or maybe some masks. What do you think I should get?

Now 4 years later, acne is coming back like I’m going through puberty or something 😐 After trying every other “normal” OTC treatment for many months at that point, I have resorted to Differin Adapalene.

When I started college last fall, I got caught up in trying new products and switching routines a lot by using different moisturizers, cleansers, and sunscreens over the past year that ended up causing more harm than good. This summer, I finally got my acne back under control but was unsatisfied with the level of shine on my face and always felt like my moisture barrier was off (I used tret for pretty much the entire time, I did not just get back into it), so I recently decided to go back to the original routine that used to work so well.

The problem is that my skin doesn’t seem ready for it. I’m not breaking out at all, but my nose gets very oily a few hours after my morning routine, while my cheeks get dry, tight, and a bit red. It feels like my moisture barrier is still compromised from a year of over-testing products that didn’t work for me. I should note that after cleansing and for the first few hours of the morning, everything is perfect; it's normally after around 5 hours that my nose gets oily and I can feel the rest of my face getting dry.

So now I’m thinking about doing a short “routine reset” to help my skin rebalance before returning fully to my old routine. I’d love some advice on what I should remove, change, or keep during this reset phase. I want to heal my skin barrier and make sure that my skin is moisturized, but I also don’t want to start breaking out again and lose all the progress with tretinoin and other actives. I also don’t know how long I should do this recovery phase, and how to best reintroduce products when my skin barrier is fixed.

Any input would be really appreciated!

I'm 47F, started tret 0.025% two months ago for antiaging. Still a bit clueless about it all so I was wondering if you could share your routines and products with me.

I'm using tret twice a week currently, I can't increase it as yet as my skin stings when I wash it in the evenings (might need a new face wash that is gentle and gets make up off).

I wash my face with water only in the morning, then Had Labo premium HA and Geek and Gorgeous peptides serum and Inkeylist Ceramide moisturizer if I feel I need the moisture, then biore SPF 50.

In the evenings I wash my face with Superdrug vit e hot cloth cleanser but I'm looking to change that one as my face started stinging from it recently. Then on tret nights I use one of the above serums, tret and the Inkeylist moisturizer from the morning. Same stuff on tret free nights.

I've noticed some skin peeling on my chin and around my mouth. I use a wash cloth to try to get it off (without much luck) but I've also ordered a bioderma atoderm baume that I saw recommended in other threads. Thinking of getting a tub of vanicream too.

I’ve been using tretinoin 0.025% for about 6–8 months, but honestly… I’m seeing zero improvements. I use it 1–2x per week with a pea-size amount. My skin is super sensitive, so I try to be careful.
Here’s what’s confusing:
	•	My under-eye area and eyelids peel, even when I keep tret far away
	•	My makeup looks fine at first, but after 1–2 hours it starts cracking and clinging to dry patches
	•	I get jawline/hormonal-looking breakouts even when I’m consistent
	•	Even before tret, my skin flaked easily
	•	I use good moisturizers (Shiseido, First Aid Beauty) and gentle cleanser (Paula’s Choice)
	•	I’m now back to daily SPF
	•	I also use azelaic acid on jaw/neck a few nights a week
I’m honestly not sure if this is:
	•	hormonal acne
	•	chronic barrier damage
	•	tret too infrequent to work
	•	tret simply too irritating for me
	•	or something else entirely

reddit,r/Tretinoin,1ozpa76,2025-11-17 19:11:07+00:00,"I’ve had acne since my teenage years. The severity has always fluctuated, sometimes better and sometimes worse, but it never fully goes away. I also have a diagnosed androgen excess and suspected PCOS. On top of that, I struggle with dermatillomania: whenever I’m deep in thought, anxious, or focused, my hand automatically goes to my face and I end up picking at anything that’s even slightly raised. So that’s my background.

I’ve been on tretinoin for about 1.5 months now (Acnatac® 10 mg/g Clindamycin + 0.25 mg/g Tretinoin). At first I used it every 2–3 days, now I’m trying for every day. But because I’m pretty ADHD, I sometimes let it slide for a few days or accidentally fall asleep on the couch without washing my face or applying the gel.

I felt like from the very first application a ton of deep pimples started coming up to the surface, and I guess I’m full on purging right now. But at this point my skin looks worse than it has in years, I’m getting more depressed again, and I don’t want to leave the house without makeup. I know the most important thing is to stay consistent and stick to the routine. I’m planning to do that. But it’s just so demotivating when things get so much worse before they get better.

Maybe someone has tips or motivating experiences that could help me.

I don’t really have a proper routine at the moment.

Morning: I wash my face with water, sometimes put on makeup. I’m not using SPF right now because UV levels where I live are 0–1 at the moment.

Evening: I’ve been washing my face with BIODERMA Sebium Gel Moussant cleansing gel and treating it with Acnatac afterwards. Sometimes I put a bit of zinc ointment on the spots I’ve picked open to help them heal.

The cleansing gel is almost empty, so I just ordered some new products that I want to slowly introduce into my routine:

Transparent Lab Oil Based Cleanser

Transparent Lab Niacinamide Glow Cream

Transparent Lab Barrier Restoring Hydrating Cream

my skin tolerates tret now, i dont purge or have flakey skin, etc, but i have new wrinkles i didnt have 4 months ago.  im only freshly 25. never used retinol before and my derm mentioned it could help with some pores but that i dont have acne. and the azelaic acid for rosacea on face and chest which i actually see a difference with on the days i use it. 

however, I feel like I have volume loss. More wrinkles. not to mention, i use vaseline all over my eyes and lips and still have chronically dry, burning stinging lip eczema now that only goes away if i take a break from tret. 

I am very hydrated, work out, eat healthy.

PM, : oil cleanser, regular cleanser, purito soothing toner, tret every other night, serum, and thicker moisturizer.

In the past 1.5 years or so, it was getting harder to find in T&amp;T and other Asian grocery stores. They were getting sold out and didn’t restock. Then I noticed it coming back into stores with new packagi Ng  and is now stocked at drugstores like Shoppers… but the formula changed and it’s not the essence feel that it used to be and smells more like sunscreen, looks like an opaque white gel. 

Did they really change the formula globally? Or is it just in Canada / North America? Does anyone know what happened? 

Btw I’m on the hunt for a new sunscreen now so will take any recommendations unless anyone can tell me where to find this in Toronto. I know there are some great premium options (love super goop) but beyond the texture of the Biore the price was just unbeatable for daily wear.

reddit,r/AsianBeauty,1p18whr,2025-11-19 14:19:26+00:00,"the big kbeauty brands have been collaborating with daiso korea to come out with a variety of affordable items. these are insanely popular in korea because of their quality for the price point. 

for anyone heading to korea anytime soon, here are some of my reviews! i stay in a hot humid country and have oily skin. i am also cheap when it comes to makeup so i can’t compare the performance to luxury brands..

_usual disclaimers: all products bought with my own money. YMMV, patch test, etc._

**MERZY: let’s fixing pen eyeliner (3000KRW)**

- black: super opaque, but flaked off easily
- brown: loved it, but the reddish undertone became really obvious after some time

**BONCEPT: waterproof eyeliner (3000KRW)**

- sister brand of tonymoly
- brown: was more smooth and could draw sharper lines compared to merzy, but the reddish undertone is obvious from the start

**BONCEPT: gel eyeliner (3000KRW) + eyeliner brush (1000KRW)**

- sister brand of tonymoly
- tonymoly has a eyeliner that’s raved about in korea
- 2 shades (black, brown)
- holy shat it was my first time using a gel eyeliner and this was SO pigmented, the brush made incredibly sharp lines

**MERZY: let’s bling dual under eye liner (5000KRW)**

- 4 shades (cool and warm tones), every pencil has the highlight and the shadow
- i think the colours may not be suitable for everyone. personally i felt that the pinks for the cool tones were way too pink
- i probably wouldn’t recommend this, colorgram in olive young has a very good range at a competitive price

**PRELUDE DINTO: nostalgia eye palette (5000KRW)**

- sister brand of dinto
- all matte (71, 72) and glitter/matte (73, 74) palettes; 71 and 73 is more cool toned while 72 and 74 is more warm toned
- 4 shades/palette
- when used with a brush, there was some fallout but not significant
- overall felt that the colours were pigmented enough and very wearable daily, hence i would recommend it

**TWOEDIT: contouring highlighter multi stick (3000KRW)**

- sister brand of luna
- 2 shades available (warm and cool tones)
- the application was incredibly smooth and i loved how natural it looked upon application

**TAG: dual multi shading (5000KRW)**

- sister brand of too cool for school
- dupe of the popular art class by robin contour
- warm and cool tone versions available
- 2 shades/palette
- it looks really natural but can be built up for a greater intensity look
- loved it, highly recommend

**IPKN PERSONAL TONE: cushion blusher (3000KRW)**

- sister brand of IPKN
- really small and compact (which also means reduced amount of product)
- got the lavender one, which was SO flattering
- blended well, loved it, highly highly recommend

**DEARTHING: blurry effect smooth touch pot (3000KRW)**

- sister brand of milktouch
- was released following the popularity of fwee’s various pots
- warm and cool tone colours available
- no matter which applicator i used, it just sat weirdly on my lips. it looked dry and wasn’t flattering for me

**TWINKLE POP: blur mud pot (5000KRW)**

- sister brand of clio
- was released following the popularity of fwee’s various pots
- colours options are much more limited
- liked this a lot more than dearthing’s version
- the texture just felt more luxurious and the colour payoff was much better

(they now have a jelly version but i haven’t tried it yet!)

**THE PURE: candy tint (3000KRW)**

- sister brand of apieu
- super super pigmented, befitting of the term “tint”
- 3 shades avail
- gave mine away in the end cos the colour was too bright for me
- if you typically wear a brighter pink/red, i do recommend that you try this. you can also wipe it away after a few minutes for a more muted tone

**[not pictured] PLAY 101: dual eye piece (3000KRW)**

- sister brand of etude house
- lots and lots of shades with a good variety of glitters and mattes. it’s labelled with recommendations of what can be used as a base colour and what are better suited as “point” colours. also labelled with cool and warm tones 
- small and compact
- 2 shade/palette
- loved the formula, there wasn’t a lot of fallout and it was super pigmented
- but the colours was just not it for me (it wouldn’t have been colours i use on a regular basis)

special mention: they have highlighters, contours, blushers of the same compact size

_notes_

- _no review of cushions/foundations because the colours are insanely pale and even as a pale asian it’s too pale for me_
- _i did not try most of the “balmy” items (like son&amp;park pots) because i’m not a fan of how it feels_
- _i did not comment on the longevity of the application because i use a fixing spray (which is a must for me in this horrendous weather)_

My all-time favourite base in terms of finish, feel, coverage was the old Purito cica clearing bb cream. It had a natural radiance, didn't emphasise pores or dry patches, and just sort of... sank into your skin.

Unfortunately, Purito 'upgraded' the formula, by which I mean... ruined. The new one is labelled 'wonder centella bb cream'.

I'm curious if others have found something with a similar finish and feel to the old formula.  
  
The closest thing that I've found is Missha M Perfect bb cream. It's close, but it's not quite right... a bit heavier, less radiant, more foundation-y. It's also fragranced.

The closest thing that I've found is Missha M Perfect bb cream. It's close, but it's not quite right... a bit heavier, less radiant, more foundation-y. It's also fragranced. 

Thank you so much!

",similar formulas to the old purito cica clearing bb cream i figure this was a popular product and the discussion might help others who are looking for a replacement my all time favourite base in terms of finish feel coverage was the old purito cica clearing bb cream it had a natural radiance didn t emphasise pores or dry patches and just sort of sank into your skin unfortunately purito upgraded the formula by which i mean ruined the new one is labelled wonder centella bb cream i m curious if others have found something with a similar finish and feel to the old formula the closest thing that i ve found is missha m perfect bb cream it s close but it s not quite right a bit heavier less radiant more foundation y it s also fragranced thank you so much,True

I have fair(ish) warm olive skin, so finding lippies that don't look orange on me is super hard. These colors are AMAZIIIING!

So, here's a quick list of the pros:

- VERY pigmented! Actually, be kinda careful with b05. After blending it I forgot to clean my finger and stained my whole hand.
- Easy to blend! You can use just your finger and it looks amazing! Just remember to clean your fingers, oopsie.
- Very smooth and soft on the lips, doesn't feel drying at all.
- Slight chocolate scent that goes away quickly. I'm very sensitive to scents, especially chocolatey ones, but I didn't have any issues with it
- Easy to remove with micellar water.
- Finally some NEUTRAL BROWNS that don't look either orange or purple!!!

And some cons:
- Not transfer proof! I kissed my cat and left a kiss mark on his paw haha.
- They are TINY! 2.2g is very little in my opinion, but for the price point it's not that bad ig

reddit,r/AsianBeauty,1oy0u5o,2025-11-15 19:40:02+00:00,"I've nearly panned most of these. Though they all serve different purposes, I wanted to post a little comparison review. I primarily use them for daily mini-masking.

**Skin type/Climate**
For context, I have combo/dehydrated skin that is very sensitive to irritation. I live in an area with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters.

## Mixsoon Galactomyces Toner Pad

- Ingredients: Nothing really special here. Galactomyces ferment is pretty low on the ingredients list. Top ingredients are humectants + niacinamide 

- Packaging: 60 pads. The little tweezers were constantly falling when I closed the box, rendering them useless. I had to constantly reach inside and contaminate the pads to grab them back out. The pads themselves are a nice thick material, like a typical cotton pad you find at a drugstore. One side is mildly exfoliating. 

- Fragrance: None. Smells ever so slightly ferment-y

- Performance: Not brightening and hydration is just okay. I do like that because the pad is thick, the essence doesn't evaporate so quickly when mini-masking. Nothing special that I can't do with my own toner and cotton pads

- Overall: WNRP. Not brightening, okay hydration, nothing special.

## Mediheal Watermide Moisture Pads

- Ingredients: Lots of humectants in this one but also quite a few oils and extracts.

- Packaging: 100 pads— I love the quantity. And because these are absolutely soaked in essence, I didn't have an issue with them drying out in the box. I like that the tweezers are long, but they're stiff to use and it's dfficult to separate pads. The pads are a silky texture, similar to a silky sheet mask. The box itself sometimes doesn't close properly and I've heard it can leak terribly. I haven't tested this and keep it right side up.

- Fragrance: I'm not sure how to describe the fragrance but there definitely is one. Not the biggest fan of it but I can tolerate it

- Performance: Hydration is great but they unfortunately do not last long at all when mini-masking. I feel like they dry up on my skin within minutes sadly. 

- Overall: WNRP. Decent hydration but dries up quickly. Prefer to DIY my own.

## Mediheal Madecassoside Blemish Pads

- Ingredients: Quite a few plant extracts and oils

- Packaging: 100 pads. Opinions are pretty much the same as the watermide ones. The pads are more of a thin gauze material and sometimes the loose threads are annoying

- Fragrance: Very strong herbal/earthy fragrance, like my asian parent's medicine cabinet (but in a good way). I personally love how it smells but I can see I being off-putting to some. Much stronger than how the sheet mask version smells 

- Performance: Very soothing! Not as soothing as the sheet masks but they do have this lovely cooling effect. Like the watermide pads, they do dry up rather quickly when mini-masking. I prefer to use the sheet masks for face use instead. But I adore using these on my eyes! I cut them in half and put them on my eyelids when I nap or sleep. They help calm down irritation and puffiness from allergies (cause of said allergies featured in second picture) or when having a sad girl day. And they feel really nice when my eyes feel strained.

- Overall: RP. My indulgent aromatherapy spa treatment. I prefer the sheet masks, but love these specifically for my eyes! 

## Torriden Balanceful Cica Toner Pads

- Ingredients: I wanted gentle exfoliation and landed on this one because it has both PHA *and* LHA, and no other actives like BHA, AHA, vitamin c, etc. 

- Packaging: 60 pads. The pads are your typical thick cotton pads from a drugstore. The exfoliating side is pretty rough imo. My skin was really not happy with it, even when used gently. I just use the normal side instead.

- Fragrance: None. The natural smell is faint and vaguely chemical in the way most AHA's and BHA's smell.

- Performance: My skin is very sensitive to irritation and can't tolerate actives very well. These have been helpful for more frequent but gentle maintenance of texture and sebaceous filaments. I do have to spot treat with something stronger for acne though. I use them every 1-2 days on my t-zone (cheeks can't tolerate it as well). I didn't realize that there is a toner version of this at the time of purchase. I would like to try that next, but the toner does have betaine salicylate and lactic acid in addition to the PHA and LHA. I'm worried it'll be too harsh for my skin. Would love to hear from anyone who's tried both! Or any other LHA + PHA products.

- Overall: RP...? Great for gentle chemical exfoliation and maintenance of texture and sebaceous filaments. Considering trying the toner version instead though.

After going through these, I vastly prefer DIYing my own for daily mini-masking.s performance-wise and cost-wise. Shout out to the unicharm silicot cotton pads for being soft, thin, and stretchable. They're still thicker than the mediheal toner pads though and last way longer on my face. 

I think toner pads are excellent for lazy days or for those that prefer a more ""all-in-one"" quick step of cleaning, exfoliating, and hydration. The exfoliating ones also tend to be much gentler than regular chemical exfoliants, so those with sensitive skin may like them. But otherwise, I've satisfied my curiosity and won't be trying any new ones.
","Toner Pad Roundup: Mixsoon, Mediheal, Torriden",https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1oy0u5o/toner_pad_roundup_mixsoon_mediheal_torriden/,576,RadiantStarr,36,"Toner Pad Roundup: Mixsoon, Mediheal, Torriden I've nearly panned most of these. Though they all serve different purposes, I wanted to post a little comparison review. I primarily use them for daily mini-masking.

**Skin type/Climate**
For context, I have combo/dehydrated skin that is very sensitive to irritation. I live in an area with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters.

## Mixsoon Galactomyces Toner Pad

- Ingredients: Nothing really special here. Galactomyces ferment is pretty low on the ingredients list. Top ingredients are humectants + niacinamide 

- Packaging: 60 pads. The little tweezers were constantly falling when I closed the box, rendering them useless. I had to constantly reach inside and contaminate the pads to grab them back out. The pads themselves are a nice thick material, like a typical cotton pad you find at a drugstore. One side is mildly exfoliating. 

- Fragrance: None. Smells ever so slightly ferment-y

- Performance: Not brightening and hydration is just okay. I do like that because the pad is thick, the essence doesn't evaporate so quickly when mini-masking. Nothing special that I can't do with my own toner and cotton pads

- Overall: WNRP. Not brightening, okay hydration, nothing special.

## Mediheal Watermide Moisture Pads

- Ingredients: Lots of humectants in this one but also quite a few oils and extracts.

- Packaging: 100 pads— I love the quantity. And because these are absolutely soaked in essence, I didn't have an issue with them drying out in the box. I like that the tweezers are long, but they're stiff to use and it's dfficult to separate pads. The pads are a silky texture, similar to a silky sheet mask. The box itself sometimes doesn't close properly and I've heard it can leak terribly. I haven't tested this and keep it right side up.

- Fragrance: I'm not sure how to describe the fragrance but there definitely is one. Not the biggest fan of it but I can tolerate it

from right to left,
1. a scattered silver sparkle with no base— a lot like the fenty diamond bomb highlighter in appearance but more silver than white

2. an ACTUALLY COOL TONED brown with purple tones 😭❤️. with a light hand its got a mauvey brown perfect contouring shadow look, if you put it on more concentrated it actually gets quite dark (for my skintone at least). 

3. a complex blue shimmer— its got a sheer greyish base, with a more finely milled shimmer than the silver sparkle. however, its still definitely on the sparkly shimmer side, and not a dusty dull western shimmer. The shimmer is blue, but it also has silver and purple reflects. a really cool color imo.

4. a satiny pigmented black

pics 1 and 2 are swatches, 3 and 4 are a quick look i threw together (my eczema is flaring up on one of my eyelids sorry they look lopsided) and the rest are packaging pics. the packaging is so pretty and high quality.

i used a very light hand for the makeup look, with just a little black as a smudged out eyeliner, you can definitely make a much more smokey or grungey look with a heavier hand on the shadows. 

other makeup used in the quick makeup look:
hourglass concealer in bisque
huda loose powder in pound cake
glossier boy brow in dark brown
nyx skinny brow pencil in ash brown (i think, the lettering lowkey wore off)
heroine volumizing mascara

pics 1 and 2 are swatches, 3 and 4 are a quick look i threw together (my eczema is flaring up on one of my eyelids sorry they look lopsided) and the rest are packaging pics. the packaging is so pretty and high quality.

i used a very light hand for the makeup look, with just a little black as a smudged out eyeliner, you can definitely make a much more smokey or grungey look with a heavier hand on the shadows. 

other makeup used in the quick makeup look:
hourglass concealer in bisque
huda loose powder in pound cake
glossier boy brow in dark brown
nyx skinny brow pencil in ash brown (i think, the lettering lowkey wore off)
heroine volumizing mascara

I wanted to know what everyone else's experience has been putting a partner onto a routine, especially for the guys who see it as quite an effort.

Are there any AIO type of products/or specific products/ingredients you incorporated because they target a wide range of concerns?

reddit,r/AsianBeauty,1ow7lin,2025-11-13 17:43:03+00:00,"TLDR: Underrated queen. If you need an oil-based cleanser and your skin is picky and tempermental, give it a shot.

The only other review for this product on this sub is more about makeup removal, so I wanted to post one from a skincare perspective. This doesn't seem to be a popular product which is unfortunate because I kind of love it.

Skin Type: Generally normal, but dries out in the winter and can go combo if I use the wrong products. Acne-prone. ""Sensitive"" may be the wrong word because I can handle some ingredients that others with sensitive skin can't handle (shea butter and tea tree for instance) but it loathes many commonly loved ingredients (niacinamide, ferments, etc.) 20's with no skin conditions like eczema or rosacea. \*Very\* easily clogged pores with sebaceous filaments that can't even be defeated with acids.

Climate: all 4 seasons, moderate/severe humidity with dry winters

Other products used: Benton Heartleaf Cream (I swapped out Vanicream Daily Moisturizer with this), Etude Mild Sunprise SPF, and a non-AB AHA mask 2x/week.

Onto the cleansing balm:

Price: Bought on sale for $11 on Amazon, usually between $13 and $20 depending on retailer.

Longevity: I haven't finished it yet but I'm projecting it to last anywhere from 4-6 months. The container is comparitively big versus other balms I've checked out (3.38floz or 100ml).

Texture: Melts well on the face with little effort. Someone commented elsewhere that the first layer when it's a brand new container is harder to dissolve than the material underneath and I've found this to be true. Once you break the ""crust"" it's sherberty and pleasant. It's not greasy and rinses 100% clean with no residue.

Scent: Mild green tea. There is fragrance in this product. I have no issue with fragrance as an ingredient but I am sensitive to strong scents (especially when overly artificial/chemically) and it's inoffensive and actually pretty nice to me. Very spa-like.

Usage: I think I've used this for over a month now with no issues to report. My results were initially obfuscated by the fact that apparently my skin doesn't like Vanicream as much as I thought it did. I switched to the Benton cream and now have no active breakouts to speak of (even with me touching my face all the time) which I honestly didn't think was possible anymore. Usually my skin hates all oil-based cleansers (Kose Speedy was a bust, BoJ Radiance Balm was a bust, among other non-AB products) but this one cleans the sebum out of my pores without an issue. My face is soft, smooth, and clean. My PIH/PIE has gone down as I've used it in part due to the healing botanicals, and in part due to having nothing to pick at. When moisturized I have a healthy sheen to my skin without it looking greasy/oily (the ""glass skin"" look is a bit much for me but I would say there's a healthy dewiness when I use this).

Another big bonus for me is that I usually break out in areas where I remove facial hair a day or two after doing so, but my breakouts related to this have reduced \*a lot\*. Maybe 1-2 small whiteheads on my chin instead of what looks like mild folliculitis on my brows/lip/chin.

I do usually feel some grits when cleansing but I tend to cleanse for a longgg time. It may also be partially towel lint so ymmv.

For makeup removal it does the job without a hassle but I do not use waterproof makeup or setting spray \*or\* primer, just non-AB clear mascara and concealer on occasion. I will say that because my texture has improved a lot, my makeup applies incredibly well (even over old acne scarring) and it looks damn near airbrushed on camera.

I looked for a long time for a good cleansing balm for sensitive acne-prone skin and I think this is probably my HG now. My skin has hated damn near everything I've used on it but this seems to be an exception. The only thing left for me now is to find a better sunscreen (the Etude is fine but it dries me out a bit and is too mattifying for my tastes).

And if you aren't one of those girls, YOU SHOULD BE, [this random youtube video](https://youtu.be/hg3Aqv4yxFI?si=zzasGLbHng7CQsJj) literally changed my life. I couldn't add collagen through natural sources though so I switched to supplements instead. I've been on them for a good few years now and doing fine so i think i am pretty qualified to make reccs?

I have no certifications whatsoever but you dont even need them with this stuff, I have tons of valid experience though and that counts just as much. So here's sort of all that I've learned over the years:

Ps i will be explaining everything in very basic terms so everyone understands it, do not expect technical jargon. 

**What is collagen?**Basically a structural protein. It’s like the glue holding together your skin, joints, bones, and even hair. Your body makes it naturally, but by the time you're in your mid 20s, production starts slowing down, that’s when you start taking supplements.

**You’ll find it as:**

* **Powders**: Mix with coffee or smoothies. Best value.
* **Capsules/tablets**: easier but you need to take like 3-6 daily
* **Liquid shots**: expensive, but easier on the go.

**How it’s different from the rest:**

This part was the most confusing for me initially. Also what a lot of girls keep questioning about on threads.

| **Supplement** | **Part it helps with** | **For** |
|---|---|---|
| Collagen | Skin, joints, elasticity | Long term effects, better with vitamin C |
| Biotin | Hair, nails | Works better if you're deficient |
| Keratin | Hair structure | Mostly topical (shampoos etc) |
| Whey Protein | Muscle repair | Not for skin/joint stuff |


So clearly it's very different from those other supplements but all of them essentially work towards making your hair/nails etc better so just take em based on whatever deficiency youve got.

**Types:**

* **Type I &amp; III**: skin, hair, nails, bones(for beauty goals)
* **Type II**: cartilage &amp; joints(if you work out or crack a lot)
* **Type V &amp; X**: less common, more niche benefits so better to consult a doctor for this

for skin+joint benefits, look for types I, II, III combo. Most brands sell it as the multi collagen blend. 

**My Reccs:**

Being the obsessive creature i am i researched my a\*\* off for the right brands, brought my picks down to top 2:


# 1. Vitauthority (Pink Lemonade Flavour)

* Types I, II, III, V &amp; X + Vit C + Hyaluronic acid
* Tastes really good (and I never say that about supplements)
* Flavors: they've got a good range but pink lemonade is my fav
* comes in this version too with fat burning ingredients if weight loss is also a goal.

# 2. ForestLeaf Peptides (Unflavored)

* Types I, II, III
* from grass fed bovine &amp; chicken
* No sugar, soy, gluten, etc.
* Has a subtle natural taste, not great for plain water(mix into a smoothie)

Both are good brands, if you wanna go clean and basic then pick forestLeaf, if you can't take a bland liquid like me tho, get the first one.

",what s the best collagen supplement to get my reccs saw a bunch of posts about girlies asking for recommendations on supplements collagen biotin and similar stuff and if you aren t one of those girls you should be this random youtube video literally changed my life i couldn t add collagen through natural sources though so i switched to supplements instead i ve been on them for a good few years now and doing fine so i think i am pretty qualified to make reccs i have no certifications whatsoever but you dont even need them with this stuff i have tons of valid experience though and that counts just as much so here s sort of all that i ve learned over the years ps i will be explaining everything in very basic terms so everyone understands it do not expect technical jargon what is collagen basically a structural protein it s like the glue holding together your skin joints bones and even hair your body makes it naturally but by the time you re in your mid 20s production starts slowing down that s when you start taking supplements you ll find it as powders mix with coffee or smoothies best value capsules tablets easier but you need to take like 3 6 daily liquid shots expensive but easier on the go how it s different from the rest this part was the most confusing for me initially also what a lot of girls keep questioning about on threads supplement part it helps with for collagen skin joints elasticity long term effects better with vitamin c biotin hair nails works better if you re deficient keratin hair structure mostly topical shampoos etc whey protein muscle repair not for skin joint stuff so clearly it s very different from those other supplements but all of them essentially work towards making your hair nails etc better so just take em based on whatever deficiency youve got types type i amp iii skin hair nails bones for beauty goals type ii cartilage amp joints if you work out or crack a lot type v amp x less common more niche benefits so better to consult a doctor for this for skin joint benefits look for types i ii iii combo most brands sell it as the multi collagen blend my reccs being the obsessive creature i am i researched my a off for the right brands brought my picks down to top 2 1 vitauthority pink lemonade flavour types i ii iii v amp x vit c hyaluronic acid tastes really good and i never say that about supplements flavors they ve got a good range but pink lemonade is my fav comes in this version too with fat burning ingredients if weight loss is also a goal 2 forestleaf peptides unflavored types i ii iii from grass fed bovine amp chicken no sugar soy gluten etc has a subtle natural taste not great for plain water mix into a smoothie both are good brands if you wanna go clean and basic then pick forestleaf if you can t take a bland liquid like me tho get the first one,True

I wanted to share my results as this sub has been very helpful on my skincare journey with different things to try. I’m 39F, started to get serious on skincare this past year when I noticed more signs of aging, prior to this the only thing I did was daily moisturizer. Over the past year I’ve tried multiple products from Zo, AlphaRet, Alastin, Cerave, Bobbi Brown, Vanicream, Acure, Medicube, The Ordinary, Illiyoon and Paula’s Choice. Below is what worked best for me, I wanted a simple routine. 
 
Morning
-Vanicream gentle face wash or Acure brightening face wash
-2-3 times a week I’ll use Acure exfoliation face wash
-Prescription Azelaic acid (from Amazon Pharmacy)
-Alastin Ultra Nourishing moisturizer
 
Night
-Vanicream gentle face wash
-Prescription tretinoin .05
-If my face feels dry or is flaking I’ll wait 30 or so mins after applying tretinoin and add vanicream moisturizing cream. I also like Illiyoon ceramide ato cream.

If it's fragrance free or has minimal to no white cast that's a bonus! 

**Should prob add other allergies:** shea, benzalkonium chloride, macadamia

**Here's a list of sunscreens I have tried:**

- ***Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Lotion SPF 50:*** in my defense I used this before I found out about my avobenzone allergy.
- ***Neutrogena Clear Face SPF55:*** I’m blaming the itchy rash on the chemical filters and totally not cuz it was expired.

- ***Bullfrog Quik Gel Sunscreen SPF 50:*** the frog drew me in. the avobenzone made me itchy.
- ***Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50:*** had to very aggressively rub this in to get rid of white cast. This is a workout I do not want. 
- ***Face Republic Purity Sun Essence SPF50+ Pa++++:*** Such promise. After 6 months it gave me a rash. Prob something to do with all the random fruit/leaf extracts. My bet's on the licorice. It also smelled weird.
- ***Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF50+ Pa++++:*** 10/10... for anything but outdoor work. I sweat it right off within 10 minutes. Light weight, smooth application. Cosmetically elegant and evens out my skin tone. I’m on my third one.

I don't have great skin by any means, but these are the only things that really bother me--I can't see anything but them, and they're right in the middle of my face in every photo. So, to that end, I'm starting a regimen that I--someone who can't be bothered to blow-dry my hair more than once a month--can realistically manage.

I've tried a bunch of stuff in the past and never stuck with it or saw no difference, so now I'm going for things that (from what I can tell) provide actual results. I would love feedback, and will try to take photos to see if I'm having any improvement. Here's the regimen:

1. Basics: sunscreen, sunglasses, moisturizer, no problem.
2. Hydration: I do not drink enough water, this is basic and absurd but it's the first thing I have to make a habit.
3. Tretinoin: \~5 nights a week, started about a month ago.
4. Light therapy: I got one of these ridiculous masks, Omnilux based on the wirecutter review. The silliest thing, which will probably not make a difference for my 11s but maybe for my skin overall. We'll see, just started yesterday. Will use \~5 mornings a week.
5. CO2 laser resurfacing: have had 3 treatments in the past 5 months, and will get two more this upcoming year. I'd prefer not to do this often because it's very expensive. 
6. Dysport: I got one round paired with the first CO2 treatment 5 months ago.

I used an AHA peel in the past, focusing on my 11s, and I think it probably helped, but without tracking over time, it's hard to say. If I were to incorporate that, it would be once a week (on a night off from tret). Is it worth it, and if so, what are your recommendations? I'd appreciate any suggestions folks have, but I won't be getting the surgery that cuts open my muscles. I will work on acceptance before that!

I’ve been using tretinoin for about 3 years, and while it’s helped with the occasional hormonal breakouts (maybe 3–4 pimples a month), I feel like I’ve hit a plateau. My main concerns now are uneven skin tone, texture, and visible pores—tret hasn’t really improved these.

I’ve heard Finacea (azelaic acid) can help with these issues, even if you don’t have active acne. Has anyone tried it mainly for texture, pores, or redness rather than acne? How did you incorporate it with tret? Did it make a noticeable difference over time?

Hey everyone! I thought I’d share this here after the positive feedback it got over on SkincareAddiction.
I’ve tested more lip products than I probably should admit, so I figured it was time to put them all in one place. I try to keep my reviews short and to the point, but if you’d like me to expand on anything, just let me know!

         
Here’s what I take into consideration when I’m rating a product:        
**Formula &amp; feel** – how it applies and wears on the lips.      
**Longevity** – how well it holds up once applied.       
**Scent &amp; flavor** (if any) – pleasant, overpowering or just off.       
**Packaging** – needs to be functional and bonus for cute.       
**Price** – value for money.
